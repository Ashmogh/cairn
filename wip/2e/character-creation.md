# Character Creation Summary

- Unless otherwise noted, every PC starts with a torch (3 uses), rations (3 uses), and 3d6 gold pieces.
- First roll on the [Backgrounds](#backgrounds) table below. A PCâ€™s background informs their potential knowledge and skills. You'll need to refer to the Background result for the next few steps.
- Choose a name from the available list, then roll on each of the included tables in the background. Record your character's items, skills, or abilities gained (or lost) from each result. See [Inventory](#inventory) for how to record items.
- Roll for your character's [Ability Scores](#ability-scores) and [Hit Protection](#hit-protection).
- Roll for the rest of your [character's traits](#character-traits-d10) and their **age** (2d20+10).
- Finally, roll on the [Bonds](#bonds) table.      

> If you are the _youngest_ character, roll on the [Omens](#omens) table. The result should be read aloud to the rest of the table.

## Backgrounds

> Some backgrounds may ask you to roll on the [Gear Tables](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/equipment#gear-tables).

## Ability Scores  

- Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes: **Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**.
- Roll 3d6 for each of your character's ability scores, in order. You may then swap any two of the results.
- Ability scores are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily weak; they can still attempt to raise a door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher. 

## Hit Protection  

- Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. 
- HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). 
- If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [**Scars**](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd#scars-1) table.

## Inventory

- Characters have a total of ten inventory slots, but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
- Each PC starts with a **backpack** that can hold up to six slots. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment. 
- Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden. When ten slots are filled, the character becomes _deprived_. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

### Item Size

Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated. 

- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. These items are rarely useful mechanically. 
- _Bulky_ items take up two slots. Armor, two-handed weapons, treasure, and some Relics.
- At the **Warden's** discretion, some smaller items (e.g. a deck of cards, dice) can be _bundled_ with one or more additional items, occupying only one slot.

> A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is _petty_ and takes no slots.

| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **d20** | **Bond**                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **1**   | You inherited a single gem (500gp, cold and brittle) from a long-dead relative. It arrived with a warning: squander your newfound riches and a debt long thought forgotten would be called.                 |
| **2**   | A distant cousin left you a small inheritance. Take **20gp**, and an **ornate compass** that always points towards something deep in **The Woods**.                                                              |
| **3**   | You carry a hand-drawn **portrait** of a past love who disappeared into **The Woods** long ago. Somehow, you know that they are still alive.                                                                     |
| **4**   | You found a **tiny crystal prism** (_petty_) buried in the dirt. When held up to the light, it shows visions of an unknown location deep within **The Woods**. Sometimes, you feel a presence looking back at you.                                                            |
| **5**   | You once freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some **silver moss**. Swallow it near water and the creature will come, once, to repay its debt.                                             |
| **6**   | You inherited an old **journal**, bound in bark. Each evening, its pages are filled with the events of the day, crassly from the journal's perspective. The writing is crude, but accurate.                      |
| **7**   | You protect a long-dormant family secret. Take one half of an **ancient key** (_petty_). They say that if joined with its twin, it opens a **Gate** through any door.                                                      |
| **8**   | You received a **letter** (_petty_) detailing incontrovertible proof that your true parontage is that of Fae nobility. The note also indicated a date and location where you are to meet them, deep in the **Woods**.          |
| **9**   | You owe a great debt to a figure of some nobility, and carry their **signet ring** (_petty_), which serves as proof both of their protection as well as your obligation.                                                   |
| **10**  | You consumed a mischievous spirit that periodically wreaks havoc on your insides, demanding to be taken home. It wants to keep you alive, at least until you are free. It can detect magic and knows quite a bit about **The Woods**.  |
| **11**  | A roaming storyteller once spun you tales of great treasure hidden deep in **The Woods**. You thought it naught but fancy, till they gave you **a rolled-up map** (_petty_) marked with an X.                                           |
| **12**  | During your travels, you met a dying hunter who asked you to deliver a message to their loved ones. Take a **letter** (_petty_), sealed with tree sap. It is addressed only to the **Lord of Winter**.                     |
| **13**  | You found a wounded beast in the forest, but chose to ignore it. You see it everywhere now, but only when you're alone. It looks sad, but not angry.                                                                                    |
| **14**  | You promised a childhood friend that you'd bring them back a rare gift, something unique in all the world. Take a **bracelet** woven from twine and wildflowers.                                                 |
| **15**  | You crossed a creature of **The Wood**, and it cursed you with a **stone heart** (bulky). With each passing month, the stone grows heavier by one slot. Until your debt is lifted, you cannot truly die.         |
| **16**  | You carved a **whistle** from an **Oak Lord's** branch. Your act did not go unnoticed. You cannot seem to rid yourself of the whistle either.                                                                    |
| **17**  | The **Dawn Brigade** did your family a service, giving you a dried blood-red flower as proof. When the flower turns white, it means the favor is owed.                                                            |
| **18**  | An entertainer once visited your home, filling it with story and song. He left one day with hardly a note, leaving behind only **a miniature lute**. Something rattles inside.                                   |
| **19**  | A white crow appeared to you in a dream, holding a twig in its mouth. You awoke the next morning with **the twig** (_petty_) in your hand. You believe it brings you luck. It smells faintly of sulfur.                                           |
| **20**  | One of your ancestors wronged a moss witch, who cursed their bloodline. Your visage causes mirrors to shatter. You've noticed that the shards can sometimes reveal illusions.                                                              |

## Omens

|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **d20** | **Omen**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **1**   | The once rich waters of a life-giving river have turned black and putrid, tainting the land and sickening those who drink from it. A village elder points to some recent desecration as the cause, but most do not heed their words.                                       |
| **2**   | It feels like winter has arrived too quickly this year, frost and snows making their appearance much earlier than expected. There is talk of a pattern to the frost found in windows, ponds, and cracks in the ground. It looks almost like a map.                       |
| **3**   | A thick, unnatural fog has descended upon an ancient and holy grove, and is slowly expanding. It is said to be the work of a great forest spirit, angered by nearby deforestation.                                                                                       |
| **4**   | The night sky grows dimmer each evening, as if stars are disappearing one by one. Rumors of hellish creatures capturing farmers and pulling them into **The Roots** are spreading like wildfire. Village elders believe the two are connected.                        |
| **5**   | The songbirds of **The Woods** have fallen eerily silent as of late. Hunters claim that a spectral figure has been spotted wandering the forest, gazing longingly at anyone it encounters.                                                                                  |
| **6**   | Strange, tear-shaped stones have been found throughout the region, sparking a "gold rush" of sorts for jewelers and thieves alike. The locals believe they are the tears of the earth itself, weeping for a great tragedy yet to come.                        |
| **7**   | Swarming pests gnaw away at the edges of dreams, and farmers speak of a loud buzzing sound emanating from deep within **The Woods**. They also say that the sound is getting closer.                                                                  |
| **8**   | There is a village known widely for its impressive "mother tree", said to hold and protect the town's secrets in its boughs. Recently it began bleeding red sap, and the elders are worried.  |
| **9**   | The moon turns a deep crimson, bathing the night in an eerie, blood-red light. Some say it heralds a time of chaos and strife, as the boundaries between **The Woods** and the mortal realm grow thin.                                                                   |
| **10**  | The "mother tree" in a respectable village has begun bleeding a thick red sap. The tree is said to hold the secrets of mortal and fae alike. |
| **11**  | A night-blooming flower once thought extinct is sprouting up throughout **The Woods**. Its scent is intoxicating, but also causes vivid nightmares.                                                                                                                      |
| **12**  | Local livestock have grown increasingly agitated and unmanageable as of late. An old shephard says its due to an unsettling howl that echoes from **The Woods** each full moon.                                                                      |
| **13**  | Swarms of insects are fleeing from **The Woods** in droves, destroying any wooden structures they come across. The sound of their wings hum a familiar tune as they pass overhead, like a forgotten nursery rhyme.                                                       |
| **14**  | Hunters talk of a curse that befalls any who kill a white-frocked beast; soon after, they are found dead in their homes. Each day, there are fewer and fewer creatures to hunt.                                      |
| **15**  | Folks say that a faint laughter can be heard, echoiing out of wells all over the city. At night, they say it sounds like sobbing, instead.                                                                                                                 |
| **16**  | The constellations have slowly started shifting in the night sky, forming unfamiliar patterns that have stargazers and sages perplexed. Even the animals seem disturbed.                                                                                                 |
| **17**  | An ancient tree at the heart of a sleepy village has suddenly withered and died, despite showing no signs of disease. After its trunk was cut, a bloody hand was found in its core.                                                                                    |
| **18**  | Statues have been weeping tears of blood each month, and no babies have been born for a bit longer than the elders think possible. Save for one, whisked away by the authorities for its own safety.                                          |
| **19**  | Local fauna are behaving oddly, displaying heightened aggression, or fleeing the area entirely. Hunters talk of a shadowy figure that roams **The Woods**, calling to the animals.                                     |
| **20**  | Border towns have become riotous in recent weeks, after multiple claims of a red-robed figure appearing in their children's dreams, uttering the same warning: A fire is coming, and it will consume them all.                                                           |
