# Downtime

## Examples
### Martial Training

A player character may spend a downtime action practicing at arms. They must choose a weapon type (blade, bow, staff, etc); it must be a weapon they've previously used and have not mastered, or a newly acquired weapon of some note. The Warden should provide a goal for learning to use the weapon better (increasing its damage die, or the player character's HP while wielding it) as well as a path for achieving their aims. 

- Attend the best-known weapons school in the Cobbles. The cost is high (300gp).
- Travel to the Marches edge to find an old master. A letter of introduction is required. Bring with you only the weapon you most fear facing in deadly combat.
-  Seek out a former adventurer, comfortably retired to the Fields. In only a few days your skill should be improved, but the bad habits you learn can never be unlearned - this is the best you'll ever be. 

### Magical Research

A player character may spend a downtime action seeking out a new Spellbook, or to create a Scroll from an existing spellbook. The Warden should provide a path for achieving their aim, including the resources and time required.

- Acquire a new Spellbook from a renowned wizard. The cost of vellum and ink is 500gp (or more) and requires the donation of a Scroll containing the same spell.
- Seek out a recluse in **The Wood** rumored to possess knowledge of ancient and forgotten magics.
- History indicates that a great library once stood atop a nearby hill, fallen long ago into **The Roots**. An active investigation (1-3 days) should yield the location of the closest **Gate**.

### Investigation

A player character may spend a downtime action researching a specific topic at a library or place of research. The player character must choose a subject they wish to research, such as the history of a particular region, the properties of a rare magical item, or the weaknesses of a specific type of monster. The Warden should provide a specific goal for the research (such as learning how to defeat a particular enemy or finding a rare potion recipe) as well as a path for achieving their aims:

- Seek out the head librarian for assistance. They are a notoriously prickly and demanding individual, but they can offer valuable insights and guidance on where to find the desired information.
- Search through the library's vast collection of texts and scrolls, using their own knowledge and intuition to locate relevant information. This will require time and effort, but may lead to unexpected discoveries.
- Request the assistance of a scholar or expert in the chosen subject, who can provide specific information and insights. However, they may require a favor in return or may not be easily convinced to assist.


### Pesonal Quest

A player character may pursue a personal goal that doesn't necessarily improve their skills, abilities, or items. The Warden should clearly provide a list of obstacles the character may encounter, one more potential outcomes, and any associated costs.
