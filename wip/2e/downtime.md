# Downtime

Between game sessions a player may select an **Action** for their player character from the [Downtime Actions](#downtime-actions) list, and then proceed according to the guidelines in the [Downtime Cycle](#downtime-cycle). 

- Downtime begins once PCs are in a safe space, and some **Actions** are not possible while Healing. 
- Players must articulate _how_ they intend to carry out the chosen **Action**. 
- Only one **Action** may be undertaken at a time, and certain **Actions** may require multiple sessions to complete. 

## Downtime Cycle

- The Warden provides 1-3 **goals** the PC must achieve, as well as any obstacles and costs (time, resources, opportunities, etc.). Only one goal may be completed per Downtime **Action**. 
- To see if they have accomplished their goal, the player _either_ rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table _or_ makes a WIL save for their character. On a success, they achieve their current goal. On a fail, the player is **Stalled** (see the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table).
- The Warden adjudicates the outcome, accounting for the PC's preparedness, resources, skills, WIL save, and so on.

| **4-5** | **Progress**    | You make significant progress toward the completion of your goal.        |
| **6**   | **Success**     | You achieve your intended goal without any significant drawbacks.        |

## Downtime Actions

### Research

A single question about a bit of lost or forgotten lore, the location of a lost item, the whereabouts of an important NPC, etc. is answered.

### Training

A character's specific skill with an item or other ability is improved, with clear narrative or mechanical results. The weapon's damage die is _enhanced_, unarmed attacksdo more damage, the PC can more easily track animals of a certain type, and so on.

### Relationships

A character's relationship with a single individual, Faction, or institution within the setting is improved. This might mean joining a particular group, or simply completing one or more tasks on their behalf (see [Factions](/wip/2e/factions#goals)) In some cases, this might mean creating their own Faction.

## Examples

### Research Examples

#### Item Location 

A player learns of a holy Relic of great power, rumored to protect the bearer from harm, or even death itself. They proclaim that they'd like to _learn the Relic's location_. The Warden then provides them with the following choices:

1. Travel to the timeless city of **Dropsilli**, where the walls fell. There is a well-known library there with more text on sacred objects than in any other, though the librarians are notoriously snooty. The trip is only possible by riverboat, and takes a week.
2. Travel to the **Granite Circle** at **Crowley Pass**, a notoriously dangerous town hewn directly into the mountain itself. They say if you can't catch a rumor about something there, it doesn't exist. The trip is two days over the _Pass_, but must be travelled by foot.

The Warden describes the time and resources required to make either journey. The player chooses their preferred option (head to the library), and describes their plan: call upon an old friend that works for a relevant Faction. The Warden creates the following goals:

   - Travel to **Dropsilli**, find lodging, make introductions at the library, and be allowed entry.
   - With the aide of the librarians, find any information on the location of the Relic. 

 The player then rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table to see if they achieve their first goal. The result is a 3, **Discovery**. The Warden tells them, "You make your way to the city with very little fanfair. The Librarians welcome you, having been told of your arrival by your friend. In mere days, you uncover a snippet from an old text referencing the Relic. It is incomplete, but you learn of the Relic's last known bearer: a long-dead priest, whose body is interred nearby **Abbulahia**, a small village only a day's walk from the library." Play continues from there. 

#### Missing Person

The party has been hired to find a missing person, believed kidnapped by the local guild of thieves, pilferers, and burglars (the **Bloody Seven**). A player volunteers to try and find out more. They suggest that the best course of action is to _infiltrate the guild_. The Warden describes a possible course of action:

- The player will need to roll up a new identity (not including HP or Attributes) and pay for their starting gear up front. There will be serious risk to both their life and reputation. 
- The Guild will likely not be easy to find, and the PC may need to first make some inquiries at less-than-reputable locales.
- The Guild may want to see evidence of the PCs skills, and will likely require the PC to perform at least one task. Only after PC has their trust will they have any chance to learn more about the missing person. 

The player agrees, and comes up with a fake identity and a believable backstory. The Warden asks the Player to roll on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. The result is a 5, **Progress**. The Warden declares, "You have successfully uncovered a way "in" to the organization. Do you want to make a WIL save to press your luck?" The Player agrees, and _fails_. The Warden says, "Unfortunately your patchwork backstory caught up with you: apparently the name you were using belonged to someone long-thought dead; now the constables have begun sniffing around, you've been forced to drop the disguise, at least for now.On the other hand: you know where to find your last contact in the Guild." 

### Training Examples

#### Weapons Training

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their skill at _two-handed blade weapons_. The Warden tells them that they have two choices:

1. Enter the fighting pits of **Gora-Mora** (there is no entry fee). They will be trained by an expert bladesmaster, and may be able to increase the weapon damage to _enhanced_! However, they might be risking their very life in the process! 
2. Hire a **Veteran bodyguard** (20gp per session) to help them train. The improvements will be gradual (three sessions per [Downtime Event](#downtime-events) roll required).



#### Improve Mapping

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their skill at _mapping a wilderness location_, in the hopes that it will decrease their chances of getting lost while travelling. The Warden provides the following choices:

1. Hire an experienced local **Guide** (15gp per session) to provide safe but highly localized training within the local region. Select a specific territory that the Guide is familiar with. After two sessions, the player may roll on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. They can continue their training until they reach a **Success**, at which point they can no longer become lost within that specific region. 
2. Travel to the **Southern Border**, between the rivers **Alcquat** and **Durang**. It is at least a three-day journey by foot. There is a hermit there, formerly of the **Guard**. They are rumored to have extensive knowledge in outdoor survival, wilderness mapping, and more! However, they are also known for having a difficult contenance, rejecting new pupils for seemingly arbitrary reasons (the Warden will roll on the [Reaction](/wip/2e/core-rules#reactions) table when the player arrives). A **Success** would mean unparalleled knowledge in wilderness survival and surveying. It is a long, drawn-out process however: expect at least 5 sessions with the master before rolling on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events).

### Relationship Examples

#### Building an Alliance 

A player wants their character to _strengthen a relationship_ with the **Order of the Helm**, a renowned knightly faction they are passingly familiar with. The Warden provides the following options:

1. Volunteer for an ongoing mission. This will likely involve several tasks such as going on patrol, escorting members, and aiding in the _Order's_ cause.
2. Formally pledge allegiance to the Order, taking the Oath and embracing their cause fully. Besides the more obvious requirements, the character can never reveal their face to any living creature so long as they serve. There will be a ceremony, and perhaps a trial.

The player chooses to present themselves to the _Order_ as a volunteer, then rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. The result is a **4**: **Progress**. The Warden describes how the character has quickly proved themselves useful, posting guard during a tense negotiona. They have earned the trust and respect of the Order, but not yet achieving full recognition.

#### Strengthening Ties

A player wishes to raise their character's status with the influential **Merchants of the Gleaming Coin**. The Warden offers these paths:

1. Invest in a new venture (foreign ale), demonstrating a modicum financial acumen and trust. This is easy, but costly: 100gp. The character could lose all of it. If successful, the character may gain formal entry into their guild hall, with access to more investment opportunities.
2. Facilitate a major trade deal or negotiation that benefits the merchants, showcasing diplomacy and business savvy. This is a difficult task, requiring time and connections to achieve.

The player decides to invest in the shipments of foreign ale. The Warden asks the player to roll on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table, and the result is a 1, **Stalled**.

The Warden describes how, just as the investment is made, unexpected complications arise. A ship carrying the traded goods is delayed, arriving far too late to be sold at the **Highland Games** festival. The _Merchants_ appreciate the attempt, but are visibly disappointed. The relationship remains neutral, with no significant gains or losses. The player may need to reassess and find another way to win the faction's favor.
