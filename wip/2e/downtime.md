# Downtime


Between sessions, a player may take an **Action** for their PC from the [Downtime Actions](#downtime-actions) list, then follow the steps in the [Downtime Cycle](#downtime-cycle).   

## Downtime Cycle

- The Warden provides a path for the player to achieve their stated **Action**, as well as a list of obstacles the character may encounter, one more potential outcomes, and any associated costs (time, resources, opportunities, etc.). 
- The player rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. The player may then choose to make a WIL save for their character. On a success, the die result increases by one step (e.g. **4-6** becomes **7-9**). On a fail, it _decreases_ by one step. 
- The Warden adjudicates the result, accounting for the PC's preparedness, resources, skills, WIL save, and so on. 

## Downtime Events

| **1**   | **Stalled**     | An unforeseen complication, distraction, or misstep forces you to pause. |
| **2-3** | **Discovery**   | A relevation or discovery provides clarity or insight into your goal.    |
| **4-5** | **Progress**    | You make significant progress toward the completion of your goal.        |
| **6**   | **Success**     | You achieve your intended goal without any significant drawbacks.        |

## Downtime Actions

### Research

The player formulates a **single question** about forgotten lore, a rare bit of knowledge, a lost Spellbook, etc. 

A player learns of a holy Relic (the **Echo Spark**) of great power. They tell the Warden, "I'd like to _learn the location of this Relic_." The Warden then provides them with the following choices:

1. Travel to the timeless city of **Dropsilli**, where the walls fell. There is rumored to be a library there with more text on sacred objects than in any other. 
2. Travel to the **Granite Circle** at **Crowley Pass**, a notoriously dangerous town hewn directly into the mountain itself. They say if you can't catch a rumor about something there, it doesn't exist.

The Warden describes the time and resources required to make either journey. The player chooses their preferred option (head to the library), describes their plan (call upon an old friend that works for a relevant Faction) then rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. The result is a 2, a **Discovery**. The Warden tells them, "You make your way to the city with very little fanfair. The Librarians welcome you, having been warned of your arrival from your friend. In mere hours you uncover a snippet from an old text referencing the Relic. It is incomplete, but you learn enough to know where you should go next: the **Ruins of Abbulahia**, a collapsed temple deep in the swamps of the South."

### Training

The player describes a **single improvement** for a skill or ability.  The Warden provides a concrete narrative or mechanical result (improving unarmed combat, _enhancing_ a weapon's damage die, learning to track, etc.).

  - Attending a well-known weapons school, usually at a very high cost (not including the weapon).
  - Travelling to a foreign land to learn from a renowned master, bearing a letter of introduction.
