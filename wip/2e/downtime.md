# Downtime

Between game sessions, players may utilize the following Downtime procedures to improve a skill, research a question, follow-up on a lead, build a relationship, and more. Downtime is possible only if the PCs are in a safe space, and may not be possible while **Healing**. 

## Downtime Overview

- A player articulates precisely _how_ they intend to achieve their goal. The Warden _may_ provide the player with multiple _choices_, each with their own unique **Milestones**.
- The Warden provides 1-5 **Milestones** that the player can tick off as they progress towards their goal. Most **Milestones** will come at a cost: overcoming an obstacle, spending a resource, traveling a great distance, time, etc. Some **Milestones** may deliver their own unique benefits as well.
- A PC may attempt to complete as many **milestones** as they like, provided they can meet the cost. A PC may make a WIL save to soften a cost, or even eliminate it entirely. On a fail they make _no_ progress, and the Warden describes any potential fallout. New milestones may be added, or the goal may need to be abandoned entirely.

> Events that occur during a regular session of play may change the stakes of Downtime activities by adding or removing costs, **Milestones**, or even entire goals. Conversely, events that occur during Downtime may impact the events of a play session!

## Examples

### Finding a lost Relic

A player learns of a holy Relic of great power, rumored to protect the bearer from harm, or even death itself. They proclaim that they'd like to _learn the Relic's location_. The Warden then provides the following outline:

"You may travel to the timeless city of **Dropsilli**, where the walls fell. There is a well-known library there with more text on sacred objects than in any other. The trip is only possible by riverboat, and takes three day's travel. Also, the librarians there are notoriously snooty." They also explain that the character may run the danger of being separated from their party, as the next session begins only eight in-world days from now.

 The player accepts this plan, but adds that they'd like to bring along a letter of introduction, signed by a powerful Count they'd met in a previous adventure. The Warden agrees, but adds that they will need to spend one additional day retrieving the letter. The Warden then creates five **Milestones**:

   - [ ] Secure a letter of recommendation. [Cost: **Time**].
   - [ ] Travel to **Dropsilli**. [Cost: **Time**, **Gold**].
   - [ ] Be granted access to the library. [Cost: **Reputation**].
   - [ ] Discover information on the location of the Relic. [Cost: **Time**].
   - [ ] Return to your party. [Cost: **Time**].

 The player feels that they can likely shave off a day by having their character force their way into the Count's office, demanding a letter. The Warden agrees, explaining that if things go badly, their reputation with the Count might wither. The player makes a **WIL** save for their character: a **success**! The Warden describes how the character, "used wit and bravado to remind the Count of their greet deeds together, retrieving not only his letter but a pre-paid ticket for the riverboat!" The player marks off one **Milestone**, and tells the Warden they'd like to begin their journey. 
 
 They agree to pay the cost (only **Time**). They mark off another **Milestone**, and the notes how much time has passed. The Warden tells them, "You make your way to the city with little fanfair. Do you present your letter of introduction to the librarians?" The player agrees, and the Warden says, "They welcome you, impressed by the letter you carry." The player marks off a _third_ **Milestone**, and adds that they'd like to begin their research immediately. 
 
 The Warden indicates that due to the size of the library, it will take at least three days to find information on their subject, and that they would be late to meet their party. Considering this, the player adds that they'd like to make a WIL save to see if their character can find what they're looking for any faster. The Warden reminds the player that these librarians are very strict; any failure to adhere to their rules will result in an immediate ban from the library. 
 
 The player pushes ahead anyway, once again making a **WIL** save. They roll a **success**! The Warden says, "You spend a day and a night researching your subject, narrowly avoiding the wrath of the ever-present librarians. Finally, you uncover a snippet from an old text referencing the Relic. It indicates that the Relic was buried with its last known bearer, a priest of some note. The grave is somewhere in the **Ruins of Abbulahia**, an abandoned city deep in the swamps to the South.‚Äù The player marks off the final **Milestone**, and announces that their character hurriedly returns to their friends. 

### Two-handed mastery

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their character's skill at the spear. The Warden indicates that they may hire a **Veteran Soldier** (30gp per session) to help them train. The improvements will be gradual, requiring a week of practice for every session. However, if they complete their training their attacks with spears would be **d10** instead of **d8**. The Warden then creates the following **Milestones** for each session:

  - [ ] Session One. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice. [Cost: **Time**].
  - [ ] Session Two. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice. [Cost: **Time**].
  - [ ] Session Three. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice. [Cost: **Time**].

The player agrees, and pays the required gold for the first session. Over the next 2 months of play sessions, the Warden indicates how much time has passed in the game world, whether the character was able to pay the cost for each subsequent milestone. Occasionally the character was unable to pay the cost: either because they lacked **Time** to practice, or because the party left their city (and the trainer) for long periods. After marking off the third **Milestone** (Session Two) the player felt their character was cocky enough to skip Practice, and that they'd like to show off their skills to the trainer. The Warden asked the player to make a WIL save, cautioning that they may injure themselves if unprepared. The player rolled, and **failed**. The Warden explained that skipping practice left the trainer unimpressed. The character makes _no_ progress, and loses money spent on the trainer. The player gruntingly agrees to not try that again. Weeks later, the player marks off the final **Milestone**, and the Warden awards them with an improved skill at the spear: d10 damage in combat. 

### Improved mapping

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their skill at _mapping a wilderness location_, in the hopes that it will decrease their chances of getting lost while travelling. The Warden says, "At the **Southern Border**, between the rivers **Alcquat** and **Durang** there lives a hermit, rumored to have extensive knowledge in outdoor survival, wilderness mapping, and more! However, they are also known for having a difficult contenance, rejecting new pupils for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Success would mean unparalleled knowledge in wilderness survival and surveying; however it will be a long, drawn-out process: at least a month of training. Finally, the journey by foot will take at least three days." 

The Warden goes on to explain that it is unlikely the player's character will be able to join the party in the next session, which begins in just a few days within the game-world. The player agrees, as they are likely going to miss the next play session anyway. The Warden puts together the following **Milestones**:

  - [ ] Journey to the **Southern Border**. [Cost: **Resources**, **Time**] 
  - [ ] Meet the **Master**. [Cost: **Personality**]
  - [ ] Train. [Cost: **Time**] 
  - [ ] Return home. [Cost: **Time**] 

The player pays the resources required for travel (3 Rations) and the Warden narrates the character's three day journey South. Upon arrival, the Warden rolls on the [Reaction](/wip/2e/core-rules#reactions) table to determine the master's countenance: **Friendly**!

### Relationships

A character's relationship with a single individual, Faction, or institution within the setting is improved. This might mean joining a particular group, or simply completing one or more tasks on their behalf (see [Factions](/wip/2e/factions#goals)) In some cases, this might mean creating their own Faction. 

### Relationship Examples

#### Building an Alliance 

A player wants their character to _strengthen a relationship_ with the **Order of the Helm**, a renowned knightly faction they are passingly familiar with. The Warden provides the following options:

1. Volunteer for an ongoing mission. This will likely involve several tasks such as going on patrol, escorting members, and aiding in the _Order's_ cause.
2. Formally pledge allegiance to the Order, taking the Oath and embracing their cause fully. Besides the more obvious requirements, the character can never reveal their face to any living creature so long as they serve. There will be a ceremony, and perhaps a trial.

The player chooses to present themselves to the _Order_ as a volunteer, then makes a **WIL** save: a **success**! The Warden describes how the character has quickly proved themselves useful, posting guard during a tense negotiona. They have earned the trust and respect of the Order, but not yet achieving full recognition.

#### Strengthening Ties

A player wishes to raise their character's status with the influential **Merchants of the Gleaming Coin**. The Warden offers these paths:

1. Invest in a new venture (foreign ale), demonstrating a modicum financial acumen and trust. This is easy, but costly: 100gp. The character could lose all of it. If successful, the character may gain formal entry into their guild hall, with access to more investment opportunities.
2. Facilitate a major trade deal or negotiation that benefits the merchants, showcasing diplomacy and business savvy. This is a difficult task, requiring time and connections to achieve.

The player decides to invest in the shipments of foreign ale. [Luck Roll?]

The Warden describes how, just as the investment is made, unexpected complications arise. A ship carrying the traded goods is delayed, arriving far too late to be sold at the **Highland Games** festival. The _Merchants_ appreciate the attempt, but are visibly disappointed. The relationship remains neutral, with no significant gains or losses. The player may need to reassess and find another way to win the faction's favor.


### Revelry Examples

1. Travel to the **Granite Circle** at **Crowley Pass**, a notoriously dangerous town hewn directly into the mountain itself. They say if you can't catch a rumor about something there, it doesn't exist. The trip is two days over the _Pass_, but must be travelled by foot.
