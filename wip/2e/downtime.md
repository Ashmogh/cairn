# Downtime

## Downtime Actions

### Personal Quest

A player character may pursue a personal goal that doesn't necessarily improve their skills, abilities, or items.   
- The Warden should clearly provide a list of obstacles the character may encounter, one more potential outcomes, and any associated costs. 
- The player rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. _After_ reading the result, the player can choose to make a WIL save for their character. On a success, the die result increases one step (e.g. **4-6** becomes **7-9**). On a fail, it _decreases_ by one step. 
- The Warden adjudicates the result, accounting for the PC's preparedness, resources, skills, WIL save, and so on. 

### Training

The player selects a specific weapon. The Warden should provide a goal for mastering that weapon (increasing its damage die, adding _blast_ damage, increasing a PC's HP while wielding it, etc.). The Warden states the monetary and technical requirements for achieving the player's aim. Examples include:

###
  - Attending a well-known weapons school, usually at a very high cost (not including the weapon).
  - Travelling to a foreign land to learn from a renowned master, bearing a letter of introduction.
  -  

### Crafting

### Research

The player formulates a **single question** about forgotten lore, a rare bit of knowledge, a lost Spellbook, etc. The Warden then provides a path to achieve their aim, including the resources, time, and travel, that may be required.

| **1-3**   | **Stalled**     | An unforeseen complication, distraction, or misstep causes you to pause your quest.                            |
| **4-6**   | **Discovery**   | You discover a piece of information or a clue that advances your personal quest or provides a new perspective. |
| **7-9**   | **Progress**    | You make consistent but unremarkable progress on your quest, keeping on track without any major developments.  |
| **10-12** | **Success**     | You achieve the intended goal without any significant issues, everything goes as planned.                      |


## Examples
### Example Research 

The players learn of an holy Relic (the **Echo Spark**) capable of reversing death. A player tells the Warden, "I'd like to **learn the location** of this Relic." The Warden then provides the following choices:

1. Travel to the timeless city of Dropsilli, where the walls fell. There is a library with more text on sacred objects than any other. 
2. Travel to the Granite Circle at Crowley Pass, a notoriously dangerous town hewn directly into the mountain itself. They say that the taverns there carry every rumor that ever was, and ever will be. 

The Warden describes the time and resources required to make either journey. The player chooses their preferred option, then rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table.
