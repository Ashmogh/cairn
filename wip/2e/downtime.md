# Downtime


Between sessions, a player may take an **Action** for their PC from the [Downtime Actions](#downtime-actions) list, then follow the steps in the [Downtime Cycle](#downtime-cycle). A player cannot take more than one **Action** at a time, and some **Actions** will take multiple sessions to resolve.

## Downtime Cycle

- The Warden provides a path for the player to achieve their stated **Action**, as well as a list of obstacles the character may encounter, one more potential outcomes, and any associated costs (time, resources, opportunities, etc.). 
- Unless otherwise indicated, the player rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. The player may then choose to make a WIL save for their character. On a success, the die result increases by one step (e.g. **4-6** becomes **7-9**). On a fail, it _decreases_ by one step. 
- The Warden adjudicates the result, accounting for the PC's preparedness, resources, skills, WIL save, and so on.

| **1**   | **Stalled**     | An unforeseen complication, distraction, or misstep forces you to pause. |
| **2-3** | **Discovery**   | A relevation or discovery provides clarity or insight into your goal.    |
| **4-5** | **Progress**    | You make significant progress toward the completion of your goal.        |
| **6**   | **Success**     | You achieve your intended goal without any significant drawbacks.        |

## Downtime Actions

### Research

The player formulates a **single question** about forgotten lore, a rare bit of knowledge, the location of a lost Spellbook, etc. 

### Training

The player describes a **single improvement** for a skill or ability.  The Warden provides a concrete narrative or mechanical result (improving unarmed combat, _enhancing_ a weapon's damage die, learning to track, etc.).

## Examples

### Research Examples

#### Item Location 

A player learns of a holy Relic of great power, rumored to protect the bearer from death itself. They proclaim that they'd like to _learn the Relic's location_. The Warden then provides them with the following choices:

1. Travel to the timeless city of **Dropsilli**, where the walls fell. There is rumored to be a library there with more text on sacred objects than in any other. The trip is only possible by riverboat, and takes a week.
2. Travel to the **Granite Circle** at **Crowley Pass**, a notoriously dangerous town hewn directly into the mountain itself. They say if you can't catch a rumor about something there, it doesn't exist. The trip is two days over the _Pass_, but must be travelled by foot.

The Warden describes the time and resources required to make either journey. The player chooses their preferred option (head to the library), describes their plan (call upon an old friend that works for a relevant Faction) then rolls on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. The result is a 2, a **Discovery**. The Warden tells them, "You make your way to the city with very little fanfair. The Librarians welcome you, having been warned of your arrival from your friend. In mere hours you uncover a snippet from an old text referencing the Relic. It is incomplete, but you learn enough to know where you should go next: the **Ruins of Abbulahia**, a collapsed temple deep in the swamps of the South."

### Training Examples

#### Weapons Training

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their skill at _two-handed blade weapons_. The Warden tells them that they have two choices:

- Enter the fighting pits of **Gora-Mora** (there is no entry fee). They will be trained by an expert bladesmaster, and may be able to increase the weapon damage to _enhanced_! However, they might be risking their very life in the process! 
- Hire a **Veteran bodyguard** (20gp per session) to help them train. The improvements will be gradual (three sessions per [Downtime Event](#downtime-events) roll required).

#### Improve Mapping

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their skill at _mapping a wilderness location_, in the hopes that it will decrease their chances of getting lost while travelling. The Warden provides the following choices:

- Hire an experienced local **Guide** (15gp per session) to provide safe but highly localized training within the local region. Select a specific territory that the Guide is familiar with. After two sessions, the player may roll on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events) table. They can continue their training until they reach a **Success**, at which point they can no longer become lost within that specific region. 
- Travel to the **Southern Border**, between the rivers **Alcquat** and **Durang**. It is at least a three-day journey by foot. There is a hermit there, formerly of the **Guard**. They are rumored to have extensive knowledge in outdoor survival, wilderness mapping, and more! However, they are also known for having a difficult contenance, rejecting new pupils for seemingly arbitrary reasons (the Warden will roll on the [Reaction](/wip/2e/core-rules#reactions) table when the player arrives). A **Success** would mean unparalleled knowledge in wilderness survival and surveying. It is a long, drawn-out process however: expect at least 5 sessions with the master before rolling on the [Downtime Events](#downtime-events).
