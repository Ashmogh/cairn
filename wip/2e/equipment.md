# Equipment

## Size

Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated. 

- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. These items are rarely useful mechanically. 
- __bulky__ items take up two slots. Armor, two-handed weapons, treasure, and some Relics.
- At the **Warden's** discretion, some smaller items (e.g. a deck of cards, dice) can be _bundled_ with one or more additional items, occupying only one slot.

## Currency

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). 
- A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is _petty_ and takes no slots.
- Treasure is highly valuable, usually _bulky_, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.
- Villages, strongholds, and ports of call will barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.

### Example

The following PC has used 7 of 10 available slots. The Chalk and Net are bundled together in one slot.

- 62gp
- Rations (3 uses)
- Lantern (__bulky__, 6 uses)
- Oil can
- Sword (d6)
- Gambeson (+1 Armor)
- Chalk + Net 
- Scarf (_petty_)
