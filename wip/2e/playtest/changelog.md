# Changelog

## Proposed edits 7-2-23

### Character Creation Summary

- [x] Change Heading Title to Character Creation Steps or Character Creation Process (It’s not really a summary, since there isn’t a longer version of it later on).
- [x] Bold items in first paragraph. 
- [x] Write Gold Pieces as Gold Pieces (GP)
- [x] In first paragraph, underline Marketplace and put page reference.
- [x] Underline Backgrounds in first bullet point.
