### Currency

- The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is _petty_ and takes no slots.
- Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.
- Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.
