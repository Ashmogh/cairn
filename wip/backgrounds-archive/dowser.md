## How did you discover your dowsing talent?

|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | As a child, you found a hidden well in your village, saving it from drought. People began to seek your guidance in finding water. Start with an additional 10 feet of rope and a small shovel. |
| 2    | Your family had a long tradition of dowsers, and you were taught the art from an early age. You've become an expert at finding not just water, but also valuable minerals. Start with a small collection of precious stones worth 2d20 gold pieces. |
| 3    | You stumbled upon your gift while practicing divination. Your dowsing rod began to move unexpectedly, revealing a secret passage beneath your feet. Start with a small book on divination and a set of divination bones. |
| 4    | In a moment of desperation, you prayed to the spirits of the land for guidance, and they answered by granting you the ability to dowse. Start with a small vial of sacred water and a prayer book. |
| 5    | A mysterious figure taught you the art of dowsing in exchange for a favor, which remains unfulfilled. Start with a sealed letter containing instructions for the favor and a curious amulet. |
| 6    | You discovered your dowsing abilities during a freak accident involving lightning. Since then, you've been able to find not only water but also electrical currents and energy sources. Start with a lightning-charred dowsing rod and a jar of lightning bugs. |

## What do you carry that might identify you?

|      |                          |                                                              |

| 1    | **Engraved Dowsing Rod** | A beautifully carved dowsing rod, a gift from a grateful village elder. Its engravings tell the story of your deeds, making it both a badge of honor and a burden of responsibility. |
| 2    | **Crystal Pendulum**     | A crystal pendulum that glows faintly when held over water or minerals. It's a conversation starter and a symbol of your talents. |
| 3    | **Waterlogged Journal**  | A journal filled with scribbled notes, maps, and diagrams of your dowsing expeditions. It's a testament to your expertise and the places you've been. |
| 4    | **Dowsing Medal**        | A medal awarded to you for your service in finding precious resources for a noble. It carries some weight in certain circles but also attracts unwanted attention. |
| 5    | **Spirit Stone**         | A small, smooth stone that supposedly contains the essence of a water spirit. It's said to enhance your dowsing abilities, but also marks you as someone who dabbles in the spiritual realm. |
| 6    | **Family Heirloom**      | An old, worn dowsing rod passed down through generations of your family. It serves as a reminder of your lineage and the expectations placed upon you. |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to....
**The Subterranean Brotherhood**. This shadowy organization believes that your dowsing abilities have revealed secrets that should remain hidden. They demand that you cease your explorations and hand over any maps, artifacts, or knowledge you've acquired. Failure to comply could lead to dangerous encounters and a relentless pursuit by their agents.
