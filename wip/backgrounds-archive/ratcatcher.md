# Rat-catcher

 > Every town has rats, and rats carry diseases and eat stored food. Most towns also have people who catch the rats. You get paid per rat you bring in - usually dead, but some people prefer live rats. 

## Starting Gear

- 3d6 gold pieces
- Three daysâ€™ rations
- A Torch
- A cudgel (d6)
- A small sack containing 1d4 rats

## Why aren't you sneaking around your usual catching spots?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 |      Plague     | You noticed the warning signs of a plague on the local rats, and decided to get out of town before the coming epidemic. |
| 2 |      Crime      | You supplied rats for the local baiting pit, but were driven out of town after a particularly bad upset |
| 3 |      Zeal       | You were simply too good at catching rats, and now you're looking for rodents that provide more of a challenge. |
| 4 | Interesting Job | You were brought in to solve the rat problem for a wealthy and particularly grateful client. The job paid well, but you decided to take a break from rat-catching for a while... |
| 5 |     Boredom     | Catching rats barely pays the bills, and having to keep innovating your technique just isn't that interesting anymore. Maybe it's time for something new? |
| 6 | Rat-bite Fever  | Every rat-catcher knows the fever is deadly, but you survived. The visions awakened a spiritual fervor, and you must spread the message. |

## What technique did you use? The tools of your trade were....

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 |    Gloves    | A pair of thick gloves, to protect your hands from rat bites. You can get more for a live rat in some places, but you can't catch many. |
| 2 |    Traps     | Two pre-made traps, like hunters use for wolves, but rat-sized. |
| 3 |    Snares    | Several hazel branches and some oaken stakes, some twine and a small carving knife to make whip snares. |
| 4 |     Bait     | A stale loaf of bread soaked in ammonia makes catching the rats a good deal easier at a later time. |
| 5 |   A Ratter   | A rat terrier, good at finding and catching rats, but hates baths. |
| 6 | A Catch-pole | A pole with a noose at one end, can catch rats in places you wouldn't stick your hand in. |
