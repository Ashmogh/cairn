| 1    | Born and raised in a small village on the edge of the Marches, you learned to navigate its dangers from a young age. You are skilled at finding shelter and sustenance in the wilds. Start with a hunting trap and a 3-in-6 chance of finding food and water in the Marches. |

| 3    | Your family were merchants who traded with settlements within the Marches. You accompanied them on their journeys, learning the lay of the land and the customs of its inhabitants. Start with a set of merchant's scales and a +1 bonus to reaction rolls with Marches locals. |
| 4    | Stricken with wanderlust, you left your mundane life behind to explore the Marches. Along the way, you've picked up a smattering of folklore and tales of the region. Start with a small collection of local legends and a +1 bonus to rolls related to Marches lore. |
| 5    | You were apprenticed to a wise elder who passed on their knowledge of the Marches, its flora and fauna, and the secrets hidden within. Start with a small herbalism kit and the ability to identify common plants and animals in the Marches. |
| 6    | You were once lost in the Marches for months, surviving by your wits alone. You've become intimately familiar with its dangers and treasures. Start with a rough map of the Marches and a +1 bonus to rolls related to finding hidden or secret paths. |
