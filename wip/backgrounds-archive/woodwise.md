## What drew you to the ways of the forest? Roll 1d6:

|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | You were raised by a reclusive hermit who taught you the ways of the woods and how to survive off the land. They vanished one day, leaving behind only a small wooden totem, carved in their likeness. |
| 2    | A profound spiritual experience in the depths of the forest compelled you to leave your former life behind. You still carry a vial of sacred spring water from the site of your revelation. |
| 3    | You were once lost in the woods and, against all odds, found your way out. You've since dedicated your life to mastering the secrets of the wilderness. You own a tattered but reliable map of the region. |
| 4    | A peculiar talking animal taught you the ways of the forest, but one day it vanished without a trace. The only thing it left behind was a small, intricate carving of the animal itself. |
| 5    | You were a member of a band of outlaws that lived deep in the forest, but eventually you decided to strike out on your own. You have a hidden cache of loot somewhere in the woods, marked by an inconspicuous carving on a tree trunk. |
| 6    | You were once a city dweller, but the corruption and pollution of urban life drove you to seek solace in the wilds. You still possess a valuable trinket from your past life, a symbol of what you left behind. |

## What keepsake from the forest do you carry with you? Roll 1d6:

|      |                      |                                                              |

| 1    | **Whispering Acorn** | When held to your ear, it softly speaks the secrets of the forest in a language only you can understand. |
| 2    | **Glowing Moss**     | A small pouch of bioluminescent moss that emits a soft, comforting light. Useful for navigating dark places without drawing attention. |
| 3    | **Bramble Rope**     | A length of rope made from the thorny vines of the forest; it can ensnare and entangle foes when used skillfully. |
| 4    | **Leaf of Serenity** | A large, perfectly preserved leaf that, when crushed and inhaled, calms the mind and eases anxiety. |
| 5    | **Chirping Twig**    | A twig that, when snapped, emits a sound mimicking a specific birdcall, useful for sending coded messages or attracting avian creatures. |
| 6    | **Fey Dewdrop**      | A delicate glass vial containing a single dewdrop from the heart of the forest; its magical properties can heal minor wounds or bestow a brief burst of energy. |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to....

The **Court of the Verdant King**, a powerful and enigmatic entity that rules over the forest. They require a rare and precious offering: the heartwood of a thousand-year-old tree, as payment for trespassing in their domain. Until the debt is paid, the forest's creatures are always watching, waiting to exact retribution.
