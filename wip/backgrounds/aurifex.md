|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **1** | Your attempts to transmute lead into gold nearly proved fatal. You survived but lost your sense of smell, save for the scent of **gold**. Take a **tin of snuff** to dampen the impacts. A day without it makes you _deprived_.                       |
| **2** | You inadvertently dematerialized a noble's beloved pet. Now the creature follows you around, invisible to everyone but you. Although it cannot interact with the physical realm, you are able to share its senses at any time (take one **Fatigue**).      |
| **3** | You were exposed to a vial of long-acting truth serum. Now, you compulsively speak the truth, and cannot lie. You carry a **Rod of Silence** (3 charges). It cancels all magical effects, including your affliction. **Recharge**: Complete a vow of silence for one week.    |
| **4** | You were never a true aurifex; instead you were adept at creating _fake_ gold. Somehow your ruse was discovered, and you were forced to flee. Take a **rod of quick-flow metal** and **gold powder**.                                |
| **5** | Your recipe for turning iron to gold worked, but a rival stole the blueprint. Your reputation ruined, you lack the funds to try again. Take a protoype **blunderbuss** (**d12**, _blast_, bulky), and a taste for revenge.         |
| **6** | Ridiculed for discovering how to turn gold into _lead_, you chose to pursue opportunities in more open-minded environs. Take a bottle of **universal solvent** (2 uses) that dissolves anything it touches into its constituant parts. |

## What marvel is the product of your latest ingenuity? Roll 1d6:

|       |                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **1** | **Pyrophoric Gel** | A sticky green fluid that catches fire when exposed to air, and burns for 8 hours. Cannot be put out.  |
| **2** | **Blast Sphere**  | A head-sized iron ball filled with explosive powder with an attached wick. d12 damage, _blast_, _bulky_.    |
| **3** | **Aqua Vita**     | Purifies any liquid, converting it to pure water. If drank directly it cures 1d6 STR. | 
| **4** | **Mimic Stone**      | Records a short phrase that can later be played back, just once.              |
| **5** | **Spark Dust** | Ignites easily and quickly. Useful for starting a fire, or as an incendiary device. 6 uses.           |
| **6** | **Homunculus**       | An animated mouse-sized replica of yourself. Though it follows your commands to the letter, it hates being enthralled to you and will try to undo your requests whenever possible. Any damage done to the homunculus is also done to you. |
