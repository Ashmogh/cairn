|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Your attempts to transmute lead into gold ended in tragedy. You survived but lost your sense of smell, save for the scent of **gold**. Take a **tin of snuff** to dampen the impacts. A day without it makes you _deprived_.                                                                                                 |
| **2** | You lost your credentials after inadvertently dematerializing a noble's beloved pet. Now the creature follows you around, invisible to everyone but you. Although it cannot interact with the physical realm, you are able to share its senses at any time (take one **Fatigue**).                                           |
| **3** | You were exposed to a vial of long-acting truth serum. Now, you compulsively speak the truth, and cannot lie. You carry a **Rod of Silence** (3 charges). It cancels all magical effects, including your affliction. **Recharge**: Complete a vow of silence for one week.                                                   |
| **4** | You never learned to actually transmute metals into gold. Instead, you became adept at creating _fake_ gold. Once your ruse was discovered however you were forced to flee. Take a **rod of quick-flow metal** and **gold powder**.                                                                                          |
| **5** | Your recipe for turning iron to gold worked, but a rival stole the blueprint. Your reputation ruined, you lack the funds to try again. Take a protoype **blunderbuss** (**d12**, _blast_, bulky), and a taste for revenge.                                                                                                   |
| **6** | Ridiculed for solving a conundrum no one had asked for (how to turn gold into lead), you left to pursue opportunities in a less ignorant environment. Take a sack of lead nuggets worth 5gp, and a bottle of **universal solvent** (2 uses, handle with care) that dissolves anything it touches into its constituant parts. |

|       |                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **4** | **Mimic Stone**      | Records a short phrase that can later be played back, just once.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **5** | **Magnium Shavings** | Ignites easily and quickly. Useful for starting a fire, or as an incendiary device. 6 uses.                                                                                                                                               |
| **6** | **Homunculus**       | An animated mouse-sized replica of yourself. Though it follows your commands to the letter, it hates being enthralled to you and will try to undo your requests whenever possible. Any damage done to the homunculus is also done to you. |
