# Barber-Surgeon

> Walking the line between healer and harrower, you understand the frailty of the flesh and the secrets that lay within. Cutting, mending and changing: with your tools, life and death dance upon the knife's edge.

## Names
Wilmot, Patch, Lancet, Sawbones, Cutwell, Humor, Landsford, Goodeye 

## Starting Gear
 
- Amputation knife (d6)
- Bandages (restores d4 STR)
- 
- 

## What procedures have you done on yourself? Roll 1d6:

|       |             |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **1** | **Ocular enhancement**. Your new eye can magnify or act as a telescope, and has minimal night vision. You cannot wear anything metal on your head.    |
| **2** | **Metatarsal upgrade**. You kept the leg, but the foot is mostly metal now. It packs a wallop (d6 damage) and you shrug off one Fatigue per day. It needs fuel - carry a **can of oil** (6 uses). Without it you are _deprived_.     |
| **3** | **Digit Replantation**. One finger has been swapped, the bone replaced by gold and iron. Take a **set of small tools** (picks, hooks, flathead) that attach to your fingertip.  |
| **4** | ****  |
| **5** | ****          |
| **6** |             |

|       |                    |                     |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------- |
| **1** | **Regrowth Salve** | It can regrow small body parts (a finger or toe) over the course of a day. 3 uses.  |
| **2** | **Graftgrub**      | A small worm that can fuse inanimate objects with parts of the body.  1 use. |
| **3** | **Woundwax**       | Heals wounds from fire or chemicals, but nothing else (restores full STR). 2 uses.   |
| **4** | **Quicksilver**    | Increases the mind's ability to cope with stress. For the next 8 hours, go first in combat and automatically pass any WIL saves. Addictive: Save STR or become _deprived_ after 24 hours without it. 4 uses. |
| **5** |  **Pneuma Pump**  | Mechanical iron lungs (_bulky). Enables life-saving surgery, or underwater breathing.           |
| **6** |  **Lodestone**   | Draws out dangerous elements from the body, and acts as a powerful magnetic force.                 |
