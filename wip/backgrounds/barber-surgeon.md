## How have you "improved" yourself? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Ocular enhancement**. Your new eye can magnify or act as a telescope, and has minimal night vision. You cannot wear anything metal on your head.                                                                                                                                          |
| **2** | **Metatarsal upgrade**. Your foot is mostly metal (d6 damage as a kick), and you treat some [tough](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#terrain-difficulty) terrain as **Easy**. Carry a **can of oil** (6 uses). Without a daily application you are _deprived_ and noisy. |
| **3** | **Digit Replantation**. One finger has been swapped, the bone replaced by gold and iron. Take a **set of small tools** (picks, hooks, flathead) that attach to your fingertip.                                                                                                              |
| **4** | **Cochlear implant**. You can hear extremely well from one ear, deciphering full conversations with a turn of the head. It is overwhelming: wear an ear flap to protect yourself from sudden noises. |
| **5** | **Reinforced ribcage**. Your chest is lined with alchemical sigils, toughening the skin and giving you Armor 1. Wearing metallic armor dampens the power, nullifying it.                                                                                                                    |
| **6** | **Detachable limb**. Your arm is fully metal, and comes off at the shoulder. It can be used as a weapon (d8, _bulky_ when not attached) and can move independently if you are within sight of it.                                                                                           |

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **1** | **Regrowth Salve** | It can regrow small body parts (a finger or toe) over the course of a day. 3 uses.                                                                                   |
| **2** | **Graftgrub**      | A small worm that can fuse inanimate objects with parts of the body.  1 use.                                                                                         |
| **3** | **Woundwax**       | Heals wounds from fire or chemicals, but nothing else (restores full STR). 2 uses.                                                                                   |
| **4** | **Quicksilver**    | A stimulant. You go first in combat and automatically pass any WIL saves for one hour. _Addictive_: Save STR or become _deprived_ after 24 hours without it. 4 uses. |
| **5** | **Pneuma Pump**    | Portable iron lungs (_bulky_). Enables life-saving surgery, or underwater breathing.                                                                                 |
| **6** | **Lodestone**      | Draws out dangerous elements from the body, and acts as a powerful magnetic force.                                                                                   |
