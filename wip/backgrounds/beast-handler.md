## What type of creature is your specialty? Roll 1d6:

|       |               |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Arachnids** | Take a **quick-flame rod** and an **oil can** (6 uses). It can destroy a large spider nest in seconds.                                                                            |
| **2** | **Felines**   | Take a sack of **whiskerwort**. Its odor can calm and control even the largest of cats.                                                                                           |
| **3** | **Canines**   | Take a wreath of **wolfbane** to herd, and a **large net** for capture. Both tools are effective against werewolves as well.                                                      |
| **4** | **Birds**     | Take a **warble-whistle** (3 charges). It can imitate any bird call, and can even be used to send simple messages. **Recharge**: Feed a baby bird as its mother would, then blow. |
| **5** | **Rodents**   | Take a **windpipe** that emits a high-pitched sound only rodents can hear. So long as you play, they will follow. Even to their deaths.                                           |
| **6** | **Serpents**  | Take a **warming stone** that generates an irresistable heat, and a vial of **antitoxin** (2 uses).                                                                               |


## What do wild creatures understand that others of your kind often do not? Roll 1d6: 

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | There is far more to the world than meets the eye. With quiet concentration, you can perceive the world through the mind of a creature of your **specialty** that you can see.                                           |
| **2** | The behavior of beasts can be a language all by itself. You can interpret the signs and patterns of your **specialty**, gaining insight into weather patterns or even impending disasters.                               |
| **3** | The pulse of the hunt is a powerful impulse. You have a sense for when predators, even those **not of your specialty**, are near.                                                                                        |
| **4** | There is an intimacy to belonging in one particular terrain. You never get lost in a terrain dominated by the beasts of your **specialty**, and may even travel a bit faster.                                            |
| **5** | Nature's symphony can be heard if you attune to its rhythm. When surrounded by creatures of your **specialty** they can act as an alarm system, alerting you to approaching danger before it arrives.                    |
| **6** | Survival is about adaptability. Once per day, you may take on a simple feature related to your **speciality** (Web fingers, night vision, etc.). You are _deprived_ afterward until you rest. |
