## How did caring for the dead change you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **1** | You found a **crow-shaped amulet** on an unidentified body. With it you can ask one question of the dead (take a **Fatigue**). They do not always speak truly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |
| **2** | You accidently released a _revenant_ from a long-forgotten tome. It scarred you, and made you a pariah amongst the living. You no longer breathe, nor do you require food. You can still feel pain, and die.                                                                                                                                                                            |     |
| **3** | You left a suicide cult after getting cold feet. Take a **Blood Pail** (_bulky_). Empty its contents to summon a creature built from items buried below (bones, rocks, pottery, etc). It obeys your command, but if destroyed you _permanently_ lose 1d4 STR. It has 6 HP, 1 Armor, 13 STR, 11 DEX, 4 WIL, shard fists (d8). **Recharge**: Fill the bucket with the blood of the dying. |     |
| **4** | Your job at the noble's tomb was part of a failed heist that landed your friends in jail, and left you a fugitive. On the bright side, you escaped with the getaway **wagon** (+8 slots, slow) and a stubborn old **donkey** (+4 slots, +2 slots with wagon).                                                                                                                           |     |
| **5** | Your family cleansed the dead in service to an obscure underworld deity. You lost your faith, but retained its teachings. You were exiled, but were given the  [_Frozen Corpse_](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#frozen-corpse) spellbook so that you may continue to serve, even as an apostate.                                                                       |     |
| **6** | You cared for the diseased and dying, until there was no one left to care for. Take a **plague doctor's mask** and a black notebook filled with names.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     |

|     |               |                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Manacles**  | Old, but still pretty effective, even against the very strong. You don't have the key.                                            |
| 2   | **Sponge**    | Made of some incredible material, supposedly from an elusive sea creature. It never seems to get dry.                             |
| 3   | **Pulley**    | Great for heaving gravestones, rocks, or even bodies.                                                                             |
| 4   | **Incense**   | Perfect for rituals, or to keep the flies at bay. Cools the blood.                                                                |
| 5   | **Crowbar**   | Sometimes you just need to get the damn thing open!                                                                               |
| 6   | **Repellent** | Powerful stuff. You're not sure what it is actually _meant_ to repel though, as the writing is faded. Perhaps everything. 3 uses. |
