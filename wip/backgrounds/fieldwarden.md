## What got the better of you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                         |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A voracious swarm of pests that swallowed crops and animals alike. With nothing to defend, you left. Take a bottle of **sprayable poison** (4 STR damage).         |
| **2** | A crops spirit, angered by your people's lack of tithings this year. Although the fires consumed nearly everything, you were able to gather a pouch of fireseeds (d8, _blast_, 10 uses).        |
| **3** | An antlered, toothy demon the likes of which you'd neve seen. Take the blood-stained **bone knife** that saved your life (d6, if given blood attacks are _enhanced_ for an hour). There something off about it. |
| **4** | _The Withering_, a type of stem rot from **The Roots**. The farmers were despondent, and there was nothing you could do to help. Take a **diseased crop** that decays any plant it touches.                        |
| **5** | Wolves. One scratch was all it took: you are now a **werewolf** [8 HP, 15 STR, 14 DEX, claws (d6+d6) or bite (d8)]. You turn when the moon is full or when on a **critical damage** fail (affects still apply). Anyone left alive from your attacks must make a WIL save to avoid infection. |
| **6** | You were derelict in your duties, and as a result a full harvest was lost. Exiled, you now take work wherever you can find it.        |

| **1** | **Bloodvine Whip** | d8 damage, _blast_. On Critical damage it drains the target's blood. For the rest of combat its damage is _enhanced_.             |
| **2** | **Clatter Keeper** | A hand-cranked device that emits a loud noise, frightening away most creatures.                                                               |
| **3** | **Sun Stick**      | When exposed to complete darkness, provides ample warmth and light for up to one hour. **Recharge**: Leave in heavy sunlight for a full day.  |
| **4** | **Root Tether**    | When thrown, binds up to a wolf-sized creature to the soil for a short time.                                                                        |
| **5** | **Greenwhistle**   | A small flute that calms plants, allowing passage without needing to cut through.                                                   |
| **6** | **Everbloom Band** | A circlet adorned with flowers that never wilt. While wearing it, you cannot die, but you can still suffer. If removed, it dissolves into dust. |
