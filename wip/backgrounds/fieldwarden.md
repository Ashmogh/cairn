## What got the better of you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                         |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A voracious swarm of pests that swallowed crops and animals alike. With nothing to defend, you left. Take a bottle of **sprayable poison** (4 STR damage).         |
| **2** | A crop spirit, angered by poor tithing. Although the fires consumed nearly everything, you were able to gather a pouch of **fireseeds** (d8, _blast_, 10 uses).        |
| **3** | An antlered, toothy demon that nearly ended you. Take the blood-stained **bone knife** that saved your life (d6, next attack is _enhanced_ after exposure to fresh blood). Something is off about it. |
| **4** | _The Withering_, a type of stem rot from **The Roots**. Take a **diseased crop** that decays any plant it touches.                        |
| **5** | Wolves. One scratch was all it took: you are now a **werewolf** [8 HP, 15 STR, 14 DEX, claws (d6+d6) or bite (d8)]. You can turn at will (once per day) but must make a WIL save to revert. Anyone left alive from your attacks must make a WIL save to avoid infection. |
| **6** | Crop thieves. Not all of them survived (you always were good good with a blade). Take a +d4 HP and a **hilted broadsword** (d8, _bulky_).  |

## What tool saved your life? Roll 1d6:

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                               |

| **1** | **Bloodvine Whip** | d8 damage, _blast_. On Critical damage it drains the target's blood, granting its next attack gains the  _blast_ quality.             |
| **2** | **Clatter Keeper** | A hand-cranked device that emits a loud noise, frightening away most creatures.                                                               |
| **3** | **Sun Stick**      | When exposed to complete darkness, provides ample warmth and light for up to one hour. **Recharge**: Leave in heavy sunlight for a full day.  |
| **4** | **Root Tether**    | When thrown, binds up to a wolf-sized creature to the soil for a short time.                                                                        |
| **5** | **Greenwhistle**   | A small flute that calms plants, allowing passage without needing to cut through.                                                   |
| **6** | **Everbloom Band** | A circlet adorned with flowers that never wilt. You cannot die while wearing it, but you feel pain. If removed, it dissolves into dust. |
