| **1** | **Western Yew** (d6, _bulky_). Can be wielded as a blunt weapon (d6). Noisy.                              |
| **2** | **Sessile Oak** (d8, _bulky_). Slams into targets. On **critical damage**, something is torn off.         |
| **3** | **Smoothbark Hickory** (d6, _blast_, _bulky_). Fires multiple shots.                                      |

| **5** | **Silverstripe Bamboo** (d6). Collapsible, it only requires one slot (still requires both hands).         |
| **6** | **Wych Elm** (d6, _bulky_). Protects the bearer from poisons and toxins, so long as they are holding it. |
