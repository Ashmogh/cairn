## Who took you in? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | An old hunter. You were both quite happy, until it all ended. Take a **weathered longbow** (d8, _bulky_) and a **leather jerkin** (1 Armor).                                 |
| **2** | A wizened apothecary, who taught you the healing arts but maintained a clinical detachment. Take a **healing ungent** (d4 STR) and a small **steel knife** (d6).                   |
| **3** | A druid, who taught you the language of trees. When it came time to leave you took with you only a **gnarled staff** (d8) and the promise that one day you would return.                              |
| **4** | A gruff blacksmith from a sleepy river town. You were kept at arm's length and separated from others. Now the forge is cold, and you've moved on. Take a **smith's hammer** (d6) and a set of **oft-mended chain mail** (2 Armor, _bulky_).                        |
| **5** | A troupe of traveling entertainers. For a time, they were like family to you. One day you woke up and they were gone with no explanation. Take a **storybook**, a **dagger** (d6), and some burning questions. |
| **6** | The monks of a secluded forest monastery. Eventually their rules became too strict, and you snuck away. Take a **monk's habit** (warm, _petty_) and a **spellbook** of _Control Plants_. |


## What keeps bad tidings at bay? Roll 1d6:

|       |                 |                                                                                                                                         |
| ----- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Pipeweed**    |Your good luck charm. Conversations tend to flow more easily after a smoke. 6 uses.                           |
| **2** | **Stink Jar**   | Shattering this jar releases an odor so foul all nearby must make a STR save or immediately vomit.                                      |
| **3** | **Ivy Worm**    | A green worm often mistaken for a weed. Swallowed whole, it absorbs any toxins or rot in the body before exiting through the usual way. |
| **4** | **Dream Stone** | A smooth blue stone that helps you recall your dreams more clearly. You have often found answers this way. Overuse can cause dream-addiction.                             |
| **5** | **Drowning Rod** | A finger-sized wooden stick that doubles in size each time it is fully submerged in water. It does not shrink down again.  |
| **6** | **Rabbit's Foot** | You were wearing it when they found you. They say it is the foot of she who left you, and that it protects you from witch magic. |
