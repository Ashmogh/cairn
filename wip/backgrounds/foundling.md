## Who took you in? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | An old hunter living a quiet life at the edge of **The Woods**. You were both happy there, until the end. There is nothing there for you now. Take a **weathered longbow** (d8, _bulky_) and a leather jerkin (1 Armor).                                    |
| **2** | A wizened apothecary from the city, who taught you knowledge and basic healing, but never gave you love. Now they are gone, along with their stifling, cold presence. Take a **healing ungent** (d4 STR) and a small **steel knife** (d6).                  |
| **3** | A druid, living in harmony with **The Woods**. You learned to survive in the wilderness, to speak the language of trees. When it came time to leave, you took with you only a **gnarled staff** (d8) and fond memories of home.                             |
| **4** | A gruff blacksmith in a sleepy river town. You were kept at arm's length, separate from the others. Now their forge is cold, and you've moved on. Take a **smith's hammer** (d6) and a **dented chain mail** (2 Armor, bulky).                              |
| **5** | A troupe of traveling entertainers. They were your family for a time. One day you woke up and they were gone, with no explanation given. Take a **story book**, a **dagger** (d6), and a strong hatred for song.                                            |
| **6** | A secluded monastery, deep in **The Woods**. The monks there held nature in great esteem, and you its bounty. Eventually their rules became to strict, and you snuck away. Take a **monk's habit** (warm, _petty_) and a **spellbook** of _Control Plants_. |


## What charm keeps you safe? Roll 1d6:

|       |                 |                                                                                                                                         |
| ----- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Pipeweed**    | Not a charm per se, but it might as well be. Conversations tend to flow more easily after a smoke.                                      |
| **2** | **Stink Jar**   | Shattering this jar releases an odor so foul all nearby must make a STR save or immediately vomit.                                      |
| **3** | **Ivy Worm**    | A green worm often mistaken for a weed. Swallowed whole, it absorbs any toxins or rot in the body before exiting through the usual way. |
| **4** | **Dream Stone** | A smooth blue stone that helps you recall your dreams more clearly. You have often found answers this way.                              |
| **5** | **Drowning Rod** | A finger-sized wooden stick that doubles in size each time it isfully submerged in water. It does not shrink down again.  |
| **6** | **Rabbit's Foot** | You were wearing it when they found you. They say it is the foot of she who left you, and that it protects you from witch magic. |
