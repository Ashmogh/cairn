- Rations (3 uses)
- Hornbeam torch (4 uses)

## How did your talents betray you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **1** | An ill-tempered spirit cursed you for stealing its heart-seed. Now any plant you touch wilts and dies. Take a **Bezoar Stone**. Ingesting it cures any poison (one use, unless retrieved). |
| **2** | Grief over a friend's death. You see their face in any tea you brew. Take a **soporific concoction**.     |
| **3** | You were poisoined, losing your sense of taste and smell. You can now withstand noxious fumes, and always carry **antitoxin** (2 uses). |
| **4** | Your radical experiments turned your skin green, and you now subsist on only copious amounts of sun and water. You don't carry **rations**, but a day without either leaves you _deprived_.       |
| **5** | Your impressive **corpseflower** won a contest in town, then promptly killed a judge. You fled, but not without the **prize money (100gp)** and a warrant for your arrest.              |
| **6** | A restorative tincture you brewed caused accidental infertility. Take a **healing potion** that completely restores STR. Only you know of its unintended side-effects.    |

## What keeps you safe while in The Woods? Roll 1d6:

| **1** | **Amadou**       | A vermillion fungus that catches flame quite easily. 6 uses.                                           |
| **2** | **Delphinium**   | Drink to hold your breath for an hour. Can be divided into multiple doses.           |
| **3** | **Tacky Stalk**  | A woody reed that, when chewed, hardens into a permanent adhesive.                                  |
| **4** | **Wisp Lantern** | Caged in wrought iron, provides a dim light so long as the wisp is able to feed on nearby pain and fear. |
| **5** | **Seed Bomb**    | A canvas sack that explode on impact, scattering seeds. d6 damage (_blast_). 3 uses.  |
| **6** | **Briarvine**    | Entangles any creature up to horse size (DEX save to avoid, STR to break). Reusable.     |
