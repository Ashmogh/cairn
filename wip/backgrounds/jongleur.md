# What happened at your final performance?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **1**    | Your troupe trained in the deadly arts to lend authenticity to your performance. An actor died, and you were blamed. Take a light-weight **rapier** (d6), a false identity, and a sneaking suspicion you were framed.
| **2**    | The crowd loved your catchy tune about a noble and his romantic failings. Unfortunately for you, the noble in question was not nearly as amused. Take a **musical instrument**, a brand (you decide where), and a the _Read Mind_ spellbook. |
| 3    |**Injury** | The exotic beast seller promised you that your purchased owlbear was toothless. Turns out beaks are just as deadly. |
| 4    |**Maddening** | A traveling astronomer pitched you a sheet music inspired by vibrations they claimed to hear while looking into the night sky. Your fluting rendered the audience into a gibbering, howling state, rasping in fear and admiration of something called "the dwellers beyond the veil of space." Not exactly your theater's name so you didn't take it as praise. |
| 5    |**Timidity** | Your one and only performance involved you staring wide-eyed into the audience for several minutes. When you finally opened your mouth to speak your lines you were caught in anxiety-induced dry heaving. Everyone uncomfortable got up and just walked out. |
| 6    |**Cursed** | The various poems you recited mocked all variety of unnatural beings and their believers as delusional. A wayward godling found your atheism disquieting and cursed you to be a magnet for the supernatural. |

# You made off with this trinket from your troupe:

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Simian Skull** | Sometimes confused for monster bones, this fanged skull smells faintly of exotic fruits. |
| 2    |**Massive Prop Weapon** | A gnarly blade resembling one of the many gods' weapons, much more intimidating until its revealed to be a wood-and-wool replica. |
| 3    |**Speculative Future Clothing** | A peculiar cotton t-shaped tunic, and rough blue trousers with a peculiar buckling apparatus near the front of the waist. This outfit is based on a fictional codex of time traveling serf to the far futures. |
| 4    |**Tome of Troubling Limericks** | These verses become less bawdy the further into the book you get, and become more and more harrowing. |
| 5    |**Many Faced Mask** | This leather and plaster mask appears mundane, but every time it is slipped off it takes the countenance of a random creature of legend. |
| 6    |**Stage Double** | Seeing as how you are out of work, your double also is. They continue to follow you day to day, but not without regularly complaining that you ruined their career. |
