# What happened at your final performance?

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **1** | Your troupe trained in the deadly arts to lend authenticity to your performance. An actor died, and you were blamed. Take a light-weight **rapier** (d6), a false identity, and a sneaking suspicion you were framed.                                                         |     |
| **2** | The people loved your catchy tune about a noble and his romantic failings. Unfortunately the noble in question was not amused. Take a **musical instrument**, a brand (you decide where), and a the _Read Mind_ **spellbook**.                                                    |     |
| **3** | Your debut composition reduced the audience to a gibbering mess, murmuring of bright creatures descending from the night sky. Later you noticed that your notes faintly resembled stellar constellations. Take a heavily-marked **book on astronomy**, and a lot of questions. |     |
| **4** | Your flowery poetry mocked a minor trickster god, long thought forgotten. They weren't pleased, and cursed you with **chronic rhyme**. You cannot speak without making a perfect rhyme. Ironically this only made you more popular among your peers.  |     |
| **5** | Your theater burned down. You believe it to be arson and carry a bitter grudge. Take a charred **play script** with missing pages, and a fire-hardened resolve.                                       |     |
| **6** | You had a terrible stage accident that left you physically scarred. The crowd cheered, thinking it was part of the act. Take a twisted **prop**, a noticeable scar, and a fear of applause.                                                 |     |

# You made off with this trinket from your troupe:

|     |                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 1   | **False Cuffs**       | Comfortable, realistic-looking cuffs. Only you know the trick to get out of them.          |
| 2   | **Benign Mimic** | A    |
| 3   | **Speculative Future Clothing** | A peculiar cotton t-shaped tunic, and rough blue trousers with a peculiar buckling apparatus near the front of the waist. This outfit is based on a fictional codex of time traveling serf to the far futures. |
| 4   | **Tome of Troubling Limericks** | These verses become less bawdy the further into the book you get, and become more and more harrowing.                                                                                                          |
| 5   | **Many Faced Mask**             | This leather and plaster mask appears mundane, but every time it is slipped off it takes the countenance of a random creature of legend.                                                                       |
| 6   | **Stage Double**                | Seeing as how you are out of work, your double also is. They continue to follow you day to day, but not without regularly complaining that you ruined their career.                                            |
