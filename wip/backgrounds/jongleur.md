# Jongleur

> What inspires in the soul more than song, words, and show? Why practice for years to learn magic, when you've already got real magic inside? 

## Starting Gear

- 3d6 gold pieces
- Rations (3 uses)
- Torch (3 uses)
- Traveller's Harness (1 Armor)
- Prop short sword (looks real)

## What happened at your final performance? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | You trained in the deadly arts to lend authenticity to your performance, perhaps too well. An actor died, and you were blamed. Take a light-weight **rapier** (d6) and a false identity. |
| **2** | The people loved your catchy tune about a noble and his romantic failings. Unfortunately the noble in question was not amused. Take a **musical instrument**, a brand (you decide where), and the _Read Mind_ **spellbook**. |
| **3** | Your debut composition reduced the audience to a gibbering mess, murmuring of bright creatures descending from the night sky. Later you noticed that your notes faintly resembled stellar constellations. Take a heavily-marked **book on astronomy**, and a lot of questions. |
| **4** | Your humorous poetry mocked a minor trickster god, long thought forgotten. They weren't pleased, and cursed you. You cannot speak unless it is in perfect rhyme. Ironically this has only made you more popular among your peers. Take an expensive **thesaurus** (100gp). Without it you are _deprived_. |
| **5** | You were scarred in an on-stage accident. The crowd cheered, thinking it was part of the act. Take well-worn **stage mail** (1 Armor), a memorable scar, and a fear of applause. |
| **6** | Your respectable puppeteering skills were matched only by your mimicry. You were so good you were branded a witch (literally) and banished. Take an **uncanny hand-puppet** and a **rabbit skull** (sewn with grass) that protects against charms.     |

## What trinket were you unable to leave behind? Roll 1d6:

|      |                                                              |                                                              |

| **1**    | **False Cuffs**              | Comfortable, realistic-looking cuffs. Only you know the trick to get out of them. |
| **2**    | **Pocket Theatre**              | A small set of small puppets and folding stage. Good for quick distractions. |
| **3**    | **Ghost Violin**         | A dark grey violin that plays a haunting tune, mirrored by an invisible, distant twin. |
| **4**    | **Tragic Tails** |    Banned in proper company, it become less bawdy and more harrowing towards the end. Worth 100gp. |
| **5**    | **Mythos Mask** |  A plaster mask that can convincingly takes on a monster's countenance. The wearer loses a **Fatigue** once it comes off. |                                                              |
| **6**    | **Rebreak Glass**      | A wine flute that can be broken multiple times, reforming after 24 hours. Make a really loud noise.   |
