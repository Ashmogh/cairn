| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| **1** | You build small contraptions for local guilds (you don't ask questions). Take a set of **artificer's tools** (_bulky_). Given time and materials, you can open almost any door or vault.       |
| **2** | You dealt in home goods and tools, improving the lives of townspeople across the lands. Roll on the **trinkets** table twice. You carry a hidden **stiletto** (d6) and are fluent in the _Traveller's Cant_.                  |
| **3** | You were a military smelter, before peace destroyed your livelihood. Take a **smelting hammer** (d10, _bulky_) and a **helm** (+1 Armor). Given time and adequete materials, you can repair armor.                       |
| **4** | You sold rare and quality items to monastaries and nobles alike. Take a **spyglass**, a **necklace** (_petty_) worth 20gp, and a scroll of [Mirrorwalk](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#100-spells). |
| **5** | You offered protection as a service, quietly watching for threats while money exchanged hands. You start with +d4 HP, and carry a **long sword** (d10, bulky) and a **brigandine** (1 Armor, bulky).                 |
| **6** | Raw tin and iron scavenged from battlefields, pulling teeth from still-twitching corpses. Start with a **donkey** (+4 slots, slow), a **crossbow** (d8 damage, _bulky_), and a **saw** (d6).                                   |

## What never fails to get you out of trouble? Roll 1d6:

|     |                    |                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Fire Eggs**      | Six small pellets made of sea salt, wood, and crockery-dust. They explode at low heat (d8, _blast_) but dissipate quickly.        |
| 2   | **Black Tar**      | Useful while carting your goods on the long lonely roads between towns. Especially if you're being followed.                      |
| 3   | **Spiked Boots**   | Cracks heads as easily as it does ice and muck (d8). Travel is also a bit slower, but easier.                                     |
| 4   | **Tinker's Paste** | Seals shut any fist-sized opening. 3 uses.                                                                                        |
| 5   | **Fireworks**      | A dazzling, albeit dangerous display. Enough explosive material to blow off a finger or three. 2 uses remain.                |
| 6   | **Riding Horse**   | This powerful steed (hooves, d6) is fast and carries you +2 slots of goods as far as you wish. You must feed it one ration a day. |
