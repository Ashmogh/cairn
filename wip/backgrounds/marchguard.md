## Why did you take the Oath?

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Your family has a long tradition of serving, and you were trained from an early age how to survive in the wilds. When taking the [**Supply**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#supply) action you find 1d6 **rations** instead of 1d4. |
| **2** | As a convict, you saw the Oath only as a means of avoiding punishment. Take a **throwing knives** (d6, 3 usess), and the key to a safehouse (_petty).                                                                                                     |
| **3** | Noble-born, you joined to escape family trouble. Take a **Goosefelt Tarp** (fits two) that you stole before leaving home.                                                                                                                                 |
| **4** | When your family lost their land, you joined to avoid becoming a burden. Take a pouch of glow-in-the-dark **Emberseeds** that explode on contact (4 uses).                                                                                                |
| **5** | Your life was saved by a member of the **Marchguard**, and you were inspired to join their ranks. Take a **snare trap** and a **sketchbook** filled with detailed drawings of the wild.                                                                   |
| **6** | Things weren't looking great, but you figured life might be easier among others. You're still not so sure. Take an **oilskin coat** and **weatherproof mapping paper**.                                                                                   |

## What do you carry as proof of your Oath?

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | **Impressive Pin** | A metal badge of honor from the Guard. It can open doors, but leaves a trail.                                                                                            |
| **2** | **Oath Compass**   | Points not towards North, but instead to the nearest member of the Guard.                                                                                                |
| **3** | **Pullstones**     | Two jet-black stones. When separated, the stones will always roll in the direction of the other.                                                                         |
| **4** | **Fireflask**      | Highly alcoholic, but strangely delicious. When lit, creates a short-living wall of flames 10ft high.                                                                    |
| **5** | **Pain Band**      | Touch an injured creature to transfer their wounds to you. They do not regain lost STR, but they may yet live. **Recharge**: A creature must die while wearing the ring. |
| **6** | **Poacher's Woe**  | Strongly-scented arrows (5 uses). The scent is powerful enough to track with ease.                                                                                      |
