## What personal code or principle do you uphold? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **No innocent blood**: You never harm bystanders, whether directly or no. Take a **steadymade buckler** (+1 Armor). While holding this shield you cannot be moved so long as both feet are planted on firm ground.                                          |
| **2** | **Revere the tools of death**: Weapons are to be respected and maintained. Take a **wyrmbone whetsone**. Following an hour-long ritualized sharpening, attacks are _enhanced_ until STR damage is dealt.                                                         |
| **3** | **To the death, always**: You never back down from a challenge or a fight, no matter the odds. Take a **death-whistle**, 1 charge. Its scream frightens away all who hear it (save WIL or flee). **Recharge**: Capture the dying breath of a dying warrior. |
| **4** | **Respect the Dead**: Death is a journey we all take, and it deserves respect. Take an extra **30gp**. You always place two gold pieces on the eyelids of a slain foe. Somehow, you always find the coin.                                                   |
| **5** | **Loyalty to the work**: Your word is your bond. Once you've accepted a job, you see it through to the end.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **6** | **Always pay your debts**: You always repay what you owe, whether in coin or in kind. You expect nothing less from others as well. Take a **blacked-out ledger**, then roll a second time on the **Bonds** table.                                           |

|       |                       |                                                                                                                         |

| **1** | **Heavy Destrier** | A beast built for war. An imposing creature. 8 HP, 1 Armor, hooves (d10+d10), +2 slots.                                  |
                       |
| **2** | **Blacklegged Dandy** | Hardy and adaptable, **Tough** or **Perilous** terrain are one step easier. 6 HP. +4 slots.                             |
| **3** | **Rivertooth**        | Impressively strong, capable of carrying heavy loads. 4 HP. +6 slots (+2 if carrying two people).                       |
| **4** | **Piebald Cob**       | Intelligent, it can understand simple commands, and even has an instinct for danger. 6 HP. +4 slots.                    |
| **5** | **Linden White**      | Highly trained and agile, this horse can perform intricate maneuvers in a time of need (no DEX save to flee). +3 slots. |
| **6** | **Stray Fogger**      | Wild, but _very fast_ (even in **Tough** terrain). Rides light. 4 HP. +2 slots.                                         |
