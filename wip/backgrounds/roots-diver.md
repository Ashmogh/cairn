## What strange fungi did you discover? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A mushroom that screams when uprooted. It's a potent **alarm shroom**.                                                             |
| **2** | A cluster of luminescent fungi. They glow softly in the dark, acting as **lamps** for several hours once plucked.                   |
| **3** | A thick, black truffle sought after by a dangerous gourmet. You still carry the **ebony truffle**, but who will you sell it to?     |
| **4** | A large mushroom that spews clouds of noxious spores. You carry a sealed jar with a **stinkshroom**. Open with caution.             |
| **5** | A mushroom shaped like a tiny house. Upon consumption, it causes the eater to shrink. You have a pouch of **shrinkcaps**.           |
| **6** | A mushroom which grew on a long-dead adventurer. It absorbed the latent magic, and you keep this **spellshroom**. Who knows its spell? |

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                       |

| **1** | **Nighteye Stone** | A smooth, obsidian-like stone that gives you darkvision for one hour.                                                                  |
| **2** | **Glowing Snail**  | This small creature casts a soft, bioluminescent light. It needs feeding with small bits of fungus.                                    |
| **3** | **Deeproot Compass**| A compass-like device that always points to the nearest large underground fungus colony.                                                |
| **4** | **Wisp-in-a-Jar**  | A tiny glowing spirit captured in a jar. Shaking the jar will make the spirit shine bright enough to illuminate your path for a moment. |
| **5** | **Silk Moth Shawl** | This garment provides warmth and can be unfurled to help you glide across small gaps.                                                   |
| **6** | **Echo Locket**    | This locket captures the last words spoken near it and plays them back when opened.                                                    |
