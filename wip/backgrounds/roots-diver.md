## What strange fungi did you discover? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Screaming Trumpet**. When exposed to light it creates a noise so loud that all nearby attacks (including your own) are _impaired_.                |
| **2** | **Torch Fungus**. When crushed it creates a heatless light for a ten minutes. 3 uses.                   |
| **3** | **Murderous Truffle**. Small, pungent and very rare (worth 50gp). Delicious but highly toxic. Illegal pretty much everywhere.    |
| **4** | **Hellcap**. An open jar can cause intense panic and even vomiting. Either way, it clears the room. 3 uses.             |
| **5** | **Sproutcup**. Ingest to shrink down to the size of a mouse (your belongings stay the same size). You return to normal size within the hour, often in fits and starts.           |
| **6** | **Rootflower**. A white fungus found only on corpses deep underground. Ingest to restore d6 WIL. You will dream of the dead, and their stories. 1 use.  |

| **1** | **Glowing Snail**  | This small creature casts a soft, bioluminescent light. It needs feeding with small bits of fungus.                                    |
| **2** | **Silk Moth Shawl** | Provides warmth.                                                   |
| **3** |     |
