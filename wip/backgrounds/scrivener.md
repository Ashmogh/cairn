|       |                      |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| **1** | **The Wild Tongue**. A bundle of leather-bound scrolls. A seminal work, cataloging the hidden languages of beasts.     |
| **2** | **A Silent Symphony**. Bound in fluorescent wrap. Very rare, it chronicles the subtle signs used by creatures employeeing invisibility magic.    |
| **3** | **A Treatise on the Abyss**. A non-descript black book. An in-depth, largely theoretical text describing **The Roots**, as well as a guide to navigating through **Gates**.   |
| **4** |  **The Star Waltz**. A comet-shaped clapse closing a fine leather cover. Detailed astronomical charts, celestial movements, and stellar festivals. Highly valued (100gp) for its usefulness to travelers.     |
| **5** | **The Cathedral and the Canopy**. Large-leaf binding over vellum. Nominally a children's storybook, the margins detail information about traveling, eating, and sleeping in the cloud forests.    |
| **6** | **Garden of Glass**. Bound in the cover of another book. A heretical work, it describes the materials, location, and procedures for opening a **Gate**.|

| **1** | **Fib Ink**        | Ink that glows when used to write true statements, but fades if used to write falsehoods.                              |
| **2** | **Cipher Stones**  | Decrypts any message written by another stone. You have a pouch with 2.                                                |
| **3** | **Everquill**      | A quill that writes on any surface. You still need ink.                                                                |
| **4** | **Whisper Vial**   | Whisper a message within and it will play back (as a whisper) the message to whomever opens it next.                   |
| **5** | **Memory Dropper** | Used to extract saliva that is later dropped directly into the eye, revealing the person's memories from the past day. |
| **6** | **Echo Scroll**    | A blank parchment that reveals the last written words of the whomever last  unfurled it.                               |
