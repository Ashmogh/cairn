# Witch Finder

> You are a mere digit on the unerring hand of justice. You go where others fear to tread, unyielding and unbroken. 

## Names
Percival, Felix, Isolde, Wolfram, Aldric, Eira, Oswin, Ivor, Brunhilda, Beatrix

## Starting Gear
 
- Vestements of the Order (_petty_)
- Blessed Tinctures
- Silver knife (d6)
- Crossbow (d8, _bulky_)

## To which order do you belong? Roll 1d6:

|       |     |
| ----- | --- |
| **1** | **Order of the Crossroads**. Take a pocket **leyfinder**. It points to nearby ley lines and other sources of arcane power. If you lose it, the punishment is death. You have a contact in most taverns willing to provide aid, food, or weapons.   |
| **2** | **Order of the Bleeding Star**. Take a **mace** (d8) made from star iron. It shines faintly in darkness, and becomes very hot in the presence of witchcraft.           |
| **3** | **Order of the Glass Sigil**. Take a short sword (d8) and chainmail (Armor, _bulky_).  |
| **4** | **Order of the Blank Eye**. Take a shard of **voidglass**. Peer through it to see invisible marks, creatures, and other magical effects. Lose the use of your eye for an hour afterwards (you are _deprived_).    |
| **5** | **Order of Canaas**. Once per day you can change into a wolf. Take a chain of quicksilver. Without it, you are unable to shift back.  |
| **6** | **Order of the Silent Veil**. Take a **quell stone** (uses) wrapped in burlap. Extinguishes any nearby flames once exposed to air.    |

## What was your vow? Roll 1d6:

|       |     |
| ----- | --- |
| **1** | **Honesty**. Choose a **weapon type** (blunt, blade, etc). Attacks against you of this type are _impaired_. If your vow is broken, you lose d4 WIL.      |
| **2** | **Poverty**. You carry the _Disassemble_ **spellbook**. Only you can use it. If your vow is broken, it explodes (d12 STR damage).     |
| **3** | **Selflessness**. Your mind and spirit are immune to magical effects such as _charm_, _hatred_, _frenzy_, and so on. If you break this vow, you lose d6 WIL.   |
| **4** | **Mercy**. Choose a **weapon type** (blunt, blade, etc). Attacks with this weapon are _enhanced_. If your vow is broken, you can never use that weapon type again.   |
| **5** | **Charity**. Once per day you can shrug off one Fatigue. If your vow is broken, you permanently lose one inventory slot.     |
| **6** | **Valor**. On inflicting **critical damage**, you receive d4 HP, returning to the previous limit at the end of combat. If your vow is broken, you die.     |
