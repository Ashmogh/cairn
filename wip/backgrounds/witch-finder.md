## To which order do you belong? Roll 1d6:

|       |     |
| ----- | --- |
| **1** | **Order of the Crossroads**. Take a pocket **leyfinder**. It points to nearby ley lines and other sources of arcane power. If you lose it, the punishment is death. You have a contact in most taverns willing to provide aid, food, or weapons.   |
| **2** | **Order of the Bleeding Star**. Take a **mace** (d8) made from star iron. It shines faintly in darkness, and becomes very hot in the presence of witchcraft.           |
| **3** | **Order of the Glass Sigil**. Take a short sword (d8) and chainmail (Armor, _bulky_). You are immune to one kind of mundane weapon (blade, blunt, etc). Choose a vow (_Honesty_, _Poverty_, _Silence_, _Mercy_, _Charity_). If you break it, you lose this ability until you make amends. |
| **4** | **Order of the Blank Eye**. Take a shard of **voidglass**. Peer through it to see invisible marks, creatures, and other magical effects. Lose the use of your eye for an hour afterwards (you are _deprived_).    |
| **5** | **Order of Canaas**. Once per day you can change into a wolf. Take a chain of quicksilver. Without it, you are unable to shift back.  |
| **6** | **Order of the Silent Veil**. Take a **quell stone** (uses) wrapped in burlap. Extinguishes any nearby flames once exposed to air.    |
