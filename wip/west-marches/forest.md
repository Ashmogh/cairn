# Forest

## Trunk (Trail Tree)

- **Spoor**: Serpent traces 
- 1. Singing Tree
  - A circle of standing stones, overgrown with moss. No grass grows in their shadow.
- 7. Leafy Village
  - A wide river where otters are playing with something shiny. It appears to be a small suit of armor.
- 12. Thorny Thickets
  - The path ends at a small pond. The water looks pure, but something moves subtly within.
- 15. Ward Circle
  - In the crook of a hollow tree, six ravens squawk and preen. If observed they stare back in silence.

## A (War Route)

- **Spoor**: Faint laughter
- 2. Knight’s Challenge
  - Bees swarm protectively around a tree brimming with honeycombs. A cloaked figure silently observes nearby.
- 3. Bloom Field
  - A troll sits holding a mirror, engaged in deep conversation with its own reflection.
- 4. Cathedral of Trees
  - A great oak has been felled, perhaps by lightning. A large hole is rent on one side.
- 5. Lost Altar
  - A robed woman is tending to a wounded animal, whispering in its ear.
- 6. Will-o’-Wisps
  - A hillside cave, wafting the scent of damp and decay. Within, a stone statue of some forgotten deity.

## B (Old Logging Road)

- **Spoor**: Peripheral images
- 8. Bandit Camp
  - Sleeping peacefully atop two boughts, a giant is snoring. The ground vibrates in response.
- 9. Old Timber Mill
  - A rotted, vine-covered cabin, clearly abandoned long ago. A delicious smell wafts from the window.
- 10. Slippery Moss
  - A lone woodwose stands directly on the path ahead, holding a large stick.

## C (Animal Path)

- **Spoor**: Animals acting strangely
- 11. Rotted Mill
  - A patch of quicksand disguised as soft ground. A broken spool of rope lies nearby.
- 12. Giant Spider Nest
  - A wounded animal, whining pitifully and limping. There is intelligence in its eyes.

## D (Cloistered Grove)

- **Spoor**: Swaying plants
- 13. Perilous Bridge
  - Wild berries grow here in abundance. None have been eaten, not even by birds.
- 14. Fungus Grotto
  - A circle of standing stones, overgrown with moss. No grass grows in their shadow.
