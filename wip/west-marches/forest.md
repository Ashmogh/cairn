# Forest

## Trunk 

- **Marker**: Trail Tree
- **Spoor**: Serpent traces 

### 1. Singing Tree

A circle of **mossy stones** form a perfect around a **large oak tree**. A **gentle melody** emanates from somewhere near the tree. 

- **Stone Circle**: No grass or vegetation grows in its shadow. They form a perfect circle around the tree.
- **Oak Tree**: Ancient, its boughs thick enough to blot out the sky above. 
- **Melody**: Lovely, induces gentle sleep after half an hour (WIL save to resist). Sleepers wake feeling refreshed (_deprivation_ is cured). 

### 7. Wildberry Bridge

Here the **Trunk** meets _The Old Logging Road_ (**B**), separated by a huge chasm. A fragile **wooden bridge** crosses the ravine. There is no way to get to **B** without it. **Wild berries** grow in unusual abundance along the trail, untouched by any creatures. 

- **Berries**: Eating the berries cures hunger and _deprivation_, but causes late-night, violent hallucinations (WIL save to snap out of it).
- **Bridge**: During the day it sways dangerously over the chasm. On a windy or stormy day a DEX save is required to get across safely. At night the bride is solid and easily crossed, regardless of the weather.

### 12. Shimmering Pond

Two paths meet the **Trunk**, winding around a serene **pond**: The _Cloistered Grove_ (**D**) to the **West** and the _Animal Path_ (**C**) to the **East**.

- **Pond**: A **Gilly Worm** thrashes about in the water, its white tail visible only after careful observation. 

#### Gilly Worm

Appears as a great serpentine creature, but in actuality is a multitude of smaller, rope-like worms acting in a hivemind. 

- 10 HP, 1 Armor, 8 STR, 15 DEX, 10 WIL, bite (d8), slam (d10)
- **Worms**: 1 HP, 1 STR, 12 DEX, 4 WIL, bite (d4). There are hundreds of them, but most will flee. 
- **Poison**: Any target suffering STR damage from its bite loses 1d4 STR each day and is _deprived_, starting the following day. An antitoxin can be procured from a single, _live_ worm.

### 15. Silent Observers

Inside a hollow **tree**, six **ravens** squawk and preen. 

- **Tree**: Its interior is carved with symbols of warding. 
- **Ravens**: The birds act as eyes for the [old witch]. They watch passers-by with keen intelligence, reporting all back to their master.

## A (War Route)

-  **Spoor**: Faint laughter

### 2. Guardian's Apiary

A massive **colony of bees** tirelessly circles a tree heavy with **glistening honeycombs**. A **shadowy figure** observes from a safe distance, completely unfazed by the swarm.

- **Bees**: Their buzzing is nearly deafening, creating a wall of sound around the tree.  Any attempt to approach the **Hive** is met with an aggressive response from the colony.
- **Hive**: Dripping with honey from bursting honeycombs. Footprints lead towards it, but stop abruptly a few feet away. A rusted short sword is lying on the ground not far away.
- **Shadowy Figure**: Leans against a long staff, their gaze is fixed on the honey. A faint herbal aroma hangs in the air around them.  No bees float near them.    
  
### 3. Bloom Field

A **large troll** sits in the middle of a vibrant field of blooms, engrossed by something  **shiny** it is holding.
- **Troll**: Sits entranced amidst the flowers, conducting a deep conversation with the **Yore Glass**.
- **Field**: The flowers, varied and plentiful, rustle and sway as if whispering to each other, even when no wind is blowing.
- **Yore Glass**: Looking into the mirror allows the holder to view any part of its life up to present day. Addictive: WIL save (once) or suffer _deprivation_ if not used daily.

### 4. Lightning Struck Grandeur

A gargantuan **fallen oak**, possibly struck by lightning, lies in the heart of a serene grove. A sizable **cavity** in its side invites explorers.

- **Fallen Oak**: The bark around the scar is unusually smooth to the touch and sparks tiny jolts of static electricity.
- **Cavity**: Large enough for a person to crawl into. Inside, it's surprisingly dry and resonates with soft, harmonious hums when the wind blows.
- **Grove**: The trees in the grove form a natural dome-like cathedral around the fallen oak. They sway in the wind, producing a soothing rustle that's almost hymnal in nature. In their roots, a network of interconnected tunnels hint at a deeper connection beneath the grove.

### 5. Otter's Gleam

The path ends at a wide, lazy **river**. A group of frolicking **otters** play with a **shiny trinket**, making odd, giggling noises. 

- **Otters**: Highly intelligent, territorial, and capable of speech. They love shiny things, fish, and cracking crayfish shells.
- **River**: Bisects the path, which continues on the other side. There is no easy way across.
- **Trinket**:  A tiny **suit of armor**, crafted in exquisite detail, as if worn for a real-life, miniature knight. The otters have claimed the suit of armor, but may be convinced to part with it.

### 6. Gloomlight Cave

The scent of damp and decay wafts from a **hillside cave**, inside which a **stone statue** presides. Mysterious **will-o'-wisps** float around the area.

- **statue**: A deity, long-forgotten. [Insert Deity information].
- **Cave**: The lair of a dangerous creature, evidenced by the scattered, gnawed bones near the entrance.
- **Unknown Deity**: The statue holds an empty bowl outstretched. Its eyes seem to follow one's movements.
- **Will-o'-Wisps**: Mischievous and potentially hostile if provoked, they flicker and dance around the area. They're drawn to the statue.

## B 

- **Type**: Old Logging Road
- **Spoor**: Peripheral images

### 8. Lost Altar

An enormous altar carved from stone blocks the path ahead. 

- **Boulder**: Immovable by conventional means, it blocks the path entirely. If exposed to darkness, it will revert back to a troll.
- **Troll**:

### 9. The Hearth

An old, vine-covered **wooden cabin**. At sundown, a delightful aroma wafts out of a broken window. 

- **Cabin**: Appears long-abandoned. A long dining room table is free from dust, protected by a beautiful white tablecloth. In the oven are human remains.
- **Meal**: At sundown every evening, a perfectly prepared meal appears on the dining room table, still warm. The food is delicious and nourishing, but leaves the eater _deprived_ the following day if more of the food is not consumed. 

### 10. Silver Falls

A majestic **waterfall** sends droplets into the sunlight, casting vibrant rainbows. A **black horn** protrudes from the cascade, its owner hidden.

- **Waterfall**: The cascade is strong, but an experienced climber could scale the rocks to the side. A hidden cave exists behind the waterfall.
- **Black Horn**: 

## C 
- **Type**: Animal Path
- **Spoor**: Animals acting strangely

### 11. Quicksand Trap

A collapsed and **rotting mill**, surrounded by **yellow dirt**.

- **Mill**: 
- **Sand**: Quicksand. DEX save to escape, failure causes the victim to sink down further (maximum 3 attempts).

### 12. Wounded Watcher

A wounded **boar** limps painfully near what seems to be large, **black mass** of leaves and wood.

- **Boar**: Has a large spider bite on one of its hindquarters. It does not run away, and its eyes hold a fierce determination.
- **Black Mass**: White silk holds the pile together. Hidden beneath is a nest of giant spiders.

## D 

- **Type**: Cloistered Grove
- **Spoor**: Swaying plants

### 13. Whispering Sanctuary

On a large, moss-covered **altar** a **red-haired woman** is tending to a **wounded fox** with soothing whispers.

- **Altar**: An ancient stone structure covered in moss and etched with symbols and burning herbs.
- **Woman**: **Annafranax**. Her whispers mend most wounds, but she seeks rare herbs to aide her work. She would repay the party in kind, as her healing skills are well-known.
- **Fox**: Her husband (a **Woodwise**). Cannot leave his current form so long as he is injured (an arrow from a tourist).

### 14. Sporestone Hollow

A **circle of mossy stones** encloses a grotto, filled with a variety of brightly colored **fungus**.

- **Stone Circle**: The stones hum softly when touched, a melodic resonance.
- **Fungus**: A few varieties are recognized as curative, but most are dangerously poisonous. Sampling the wrong one could lead to paralysis, hallucinations, or even transformation into a fungal creature.
