# Forest

## Trunk (Trail Tree)

- **Spoor**: Serpent traces 

### 1. Singing Tree

A circle of **mossy stones** form a perfect around a **large oak tree**. A **gentle melody** emanates from somewhere near the tree. 

### **Stone Circle**: No grass or vegetation grows in its shadow. They form a perfect circle around the tree.
### **Oak Tree**: Ancient. The boughs are thick enough to blot out the sky. 
### **Melody**: Lovely, induces gentle sleep after half an hour (WIL save to resist). Sleepers wake feeling refreshed (_deprivation_ is cured). 

### 7. Leafy Village
  - A wide river where otters are playing with something shiny. It appears to be a small suit of armor.
### 12. Thorny Thickets
  - The path ends at a small pond. The water looks pure, but something moves subtly within.
### 15. Ward Circle
  - In the crook of a hollow tree, six ravens squawk and preen. If observed they stare back in silence.

## A (War Route)

-  **Spoor**: Faint laughter

### 2. Guardian's Apiary

A massive **colony of bees** tirelessly circles a tree heavy with **glistening honeycombs**. A **shadowy figure** observes from a safe distance, completely unfazed by the swarm.

- **Bees**: Their buzzing is nearly deafening, creating a wall of sound around the tree.  Any attempt to approach the **Hive** is met with an aggressive response from the colony.
- **Hive**: Dripping with honey from bursting honeycombs. Footprints lead towards it, but stop abruptly a few feet away. A rusted short sword is lying on the ground not far away.
- **Shadowy Figure**: Leans against a long staff, their gaze is fixed on the honey. A faint herbal aroma hangs in the air around them.  No bees float near them.    
  
### 3. Bloom Field

A **large troll** sits in the middle of a vibrant field of blooms, engrossed in dialogue with someone. It is holding something **shiny**.
- **Troll**: Sits entranced amidst the flowers, conducting a deep conversation with the **Hope Glass**.
- **Field**: The flowers, varied and plentiful, rustle and sway as if whispering to each other, even when no wind blows.
- **Hope Glass**: Looking into the mirror allows the holder to talk itself, one year in the future. If the mirror reflects nothing, their spirit is elsewhere. 1 use per person (permanent). **Recharges** when given willingly to another.  

### 4. Cathedral of Trees
  - A great oak has been felled, perhaps by lightning. A large hole is rent on one side.
  
### 5. Lost Altar
  - A robed woman is tending to a wounded animal, whispering in its ear.
### 6. Will-oâ€™-Wisps
  - A hillside cave, wafting the scent of damp and decay. Within, a stone statue of some forgotten deity.

## B (Old Logging Road)

- **Spoor**: Peripheral images

### 8. Bandit Camp
  - Sleeping peacefully atop two boughts, a giant is snoring. The ground vibrates in response.
### 9. Old Timber Mill
  - A rotted, vine-covered cabin, clearly abandoned long ago. A delicious smell wafts from the window.
### 10. Slippery Moss
  - A lone woodwose stands directly on the path ahead, holding a large stick.

## C (Animal Path)

- **Spoor**: Animals acting strangely

### 11. Rotted Mill
  - A patch of quicksand disguised as soft ground. A broken spool of rope lies nearby.
### 12. Giant Spider Nest
  - A wounded animal, whining pitifully and limping. There is intelligence in its eyes.

## D (Cloistered Grove)

- **Spoor**: Swaying plants

### 13. Perilous Bridge
  - Wild berries grow here in abundance. None have been eaten, not even by birds.
### 14. Fungus Grotto
  - A circle of standing stones, overgrown with moss. No grass grows in their shadow.
