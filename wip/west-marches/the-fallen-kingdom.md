# The Fallen Kingdom

## Basics

### Geographic themes
- Forest on all sides, 1-9
- Southern-flowing river, spilling into a waterfall (Heart)
- Heart is only traversable by stopping at encampment North, then trekking down. Cloud forest?
- River continues as land opens to non-forest, mostly plains, plateaus, grasslands etc but mountain range on the west side
- Current weather: Drizzly
- River: The Scar
- Forest? The Watersilk Weald?
- Language family

### Summary

A valley, discovered only decades earlier. Covered by thick forest and jungles, divided by a powerful river (The Scar). Ruins of an advanced civilization dot the forested landscape, but no evidence of their demise has been discovered.

A large waterfall (God's Spill) marks a central feature of the Upper Valley. The region's pseudo-capital (Waterfall City) draws from the fall's power to create mechanical marvels (lamps, machines), bringing the city great fame. Made possible only through the discovery of a relic called The Wheel, the city's majesty has spurred a Relic "gold rush", attracting prospectors and colonists the world over.   

The Fallen Kingdom's Southern Valley (beyond Dunny Town) is largely unexplored. Colonists and explorers have traveled South along the river, but few have returned. Those that did tell only inconsistent, wild and impossible tales.

### 1. Waterfall City

- Adjacent to an enormous waterfall
- The Great Waterwheel: Powers the city, turning a great wheel.
- Thunder Market: an enormous trading center, set to the backdrop of the roaring falls.
- Rainbow Wharf: An important food source, supplying the city with fresh fish from the river.
- The Wets: A public space in the city, constantly covered in a mist from the waterfall.
- The Spillway: A lively district with shops, cafes, and restaurants that offer a picturesque view of the waterfall.
- The Cataract: The city's fortified heart, where the local government operates, located on a prominent outcrop overseeing the entire city.
- The Foot: A district at the bottom of the waterfall that serves as the city's industrial area, using the power of the falling water to operate mills and factories.

### 2. Reprieve

- Oasis and river basin, serves as a starting point for a difficult hike.
- Overgrown garden maze: a mysterious, ancient site overgrown with greenery.
- Views of the entire valley: panoramic views of the waterfall and valley.
- The hike: an 8 hr journey to **Waterfall City**. 12 hours uphill.

### 3. Gloomlight Cave

A former religious site, its original purpose lost to time. Locals make pilgrimages to the cave but never enter, leaving their wishes (curled-up scrolls) in the pitted alcoves that mar the hillside. The path gradually becomes broken cobblestone steps that lead up a hill towards a small **cave**. Something like firelight is flickering within. 

- **Cave**: 100 steps exactly to the entrance. Small, the cave appears several hundred years old. Within, a **small lamp** is lit at the feet of an enormous staue. Behind the statue the cave continues for only a short while.
- **Lamp**: Wrought iron, containing a trapped **Will-oâ€™-Wisp** within. Survives on the energy of nearby pain and suffering. It is brighter on the side closer to the statue.
  - **Will-o-wisp**: Placed here by its master to feed, then forgotten. Over the decades it has gone quite mad, but contains enough energy to swallow a small village if destroyed.    
- **Statue**: A troglodytic figure with goat-like eyes holds an empty bowl in each palm. One has ash, the other a feather. Built for a deity by worshipers many centuries ago, it is all but forgotten now. The **bowls** do nothing special. 
  - The Will-o-wisp feeds from its anguish, and in turn the god is not forgotten. If the lamp is taken away, it loses its last true believer.
